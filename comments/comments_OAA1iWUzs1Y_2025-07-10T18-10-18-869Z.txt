Text: I love my job but ever since my boss hired his roommate 5 years ago, it‚Äôs been an emotional roller coaster because she believes she doesn‚Äôt have to follow the same rules. I‚Äôve worked there for 10 years and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have a lot of thinking to do this week. Thank you for an amazing reading!! üôèüèª

Text: Aries moon here, I contemplated still the difference in asc/moon/sun aries how the vibe and aura or energetic field is, the more I contemplate the 12th house as Virgo asc, and how Sun leo people are presenting themselves in my life, I feel as I meet very weird and quirky Leo&#39;s that it enacts often this drive of unity, in this circular collective motion, where when I talk to the individual or even the Leo, I open up a whole can of worms, and as they often come and help me in weird times, yet sabotage the more innocent non-judgemental people due to imagery, and I tank 99.9% of the hits, and disguise it with humour, I missed a lot of opportunities for growth, and even then the grow opportunities sort of spun me back to these experiences, as I decided this is not for me, as well as they somehow never are interested to include me into their plans, even if my friends might have been more surface boring they had more depth than anyone can even catch more status and power, if the Leo cares about this or character, yet the impatient attitude and sort of the whole idea of higher service was missing in that regard, as I meet more laid-back nerdy people who&#39;re not to nerdy and know when to be quiet in a sense or talk more, and generally are more educated and knowledgeable, instead of party friends who figure out their lives that way. <br><br>Contemplating aries ascendent I&#39;d realize I can clearly spot the type of growth and lies the people do, if you&#39;d track them more closely as moon and sun this is most likely not their style and experience, and Aries sun imo, has been one of the most guarded people I meet about their private lifes, only telling me mostly when we&#39;re exploring smth. often what they think to some extend. Leo&#39;s harboured so many secrets and told me them upfront to even tell me more, and not even tell me half of it, that I was like wtf am I supposed to do with this, everytime I meet a Leo they ditch out for their fame/fake friends who will just fall into their back, I lost a lot of extremely good friends, due to mistakes I made and just differences in character and personality, and interests. It&#39;s quiet odd, how I form a harmony with them or a sextile etc. as gem sun, it&#39;s odd as in the end it&#39;s some earth, water or air sign that helps me out to some extend. Somehow Leo&#39;s just create a weird rampage and never care about creating smth. unique till they do and I somehow spiral back to them in the odd ways I work, and my consciouness created some entirely new rhythm that reverbaretes differently, yet mostly through soul/spirit not astrology, yet consciouness and meditative practices. <br><br>The entire point is even now, conscious just haunts me to some extend, and I notice the beauty of it utterly, I noticed as I had a professor like this if they never get into spirituality, they will never comprehend what I see daily, I am not that distracted with people, and their lives, if I get options I do my best to make them choices and grow, yet I had to realize I wanted to include people not ready for a path of adventure that is streaks and depth of consciouness as they are obsessed with fame, that they will never ever ever get, if they are not consciously choosing to be part of humanities soul, what do you want? Not die and still be super fame? I don&#39;t get it. I wonder as I felt a lot of connection and empathy for the powerful human beigns, yet from a different space that is more detached and mercury like and chatty? I don&#39;t get it similar to the last position... CEO comes to me says hello and greats me, then again connected to freaking powerful people eventually just by memes I saw idk if it&#39;s true took me a while to find it. The only one worthy I&#39;d call clean, in the end what happens, the actual collective does the work, the leadership gets free info from IT, is being lazy and the only one moving mountains is acting like my father and mother being a childish leadership couple and I am the face of their success, especially when it comes to YOUTH, where I notice Leo and Gemini as well as Aquarious usually shine, and I am like oh why the fuck am I torturing myself with conformity again, when quiet work and solving stuff would just be fine. (ASC virgo 100%) <br><br>Then I am like hm... I really wanted to explore stuff while I am being forced to settle down, and just take a beer at times chill with some good music after an enjoyable work week that I created nice routines and not do soul clean up for stuff, I have interest and hobbies and like to read, I enjoy entertaining others to some extend, yet I really really enjoy watching the world, I&#39;d rather would&#39;ve planned something beautiful and enacted a plan, instead of chasing concerts and just relax a bit even then it was possible, yet holy shit egotism can be so high, like this was also with another Leo friend I was interested to go with him to asia and I&#39;d pay upfront for both during the time I was not broke, and he instead included a different set of people later, and I had not the luxury to nerd out on friend topics, and meet more educated people, in the end I wondered what is all of that excitement seeking about? I travled to explore and expand my consciouness and not to have fun and relax, idk very weird same reason I went to concerts, to enjoy and expand consciouness see the consciouness of the artist, not only the energy field, but the depth of it. They noticed it too when I went, for instance years ago, yet quiet frankly that is the oddest connection I have to air signs I could possible relate to, if you&#39;re an air sign and you go to a concert and your blown away by the consciouness of the whole experience you know what I mean, and why I for instance love music and art. I don&#39;t know I leave it at that.
