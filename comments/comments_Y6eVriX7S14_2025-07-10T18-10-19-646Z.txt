Text: Thank you so much for your readings 🙏 I am 63 and I’ve written my first ever book a children’s book and it’s being printed as we speak it will be for sale in top retailer book stores and Amazon and even though I’m excited about it I’m also not looking forward to promoting it. I have all these ideas in what I should be doing to sell them but fear kicks in but I know I have to go through that fear and not listen to my ego… Im sure all will go well 🙏🥰✨🦋🌈💚

Text: Jimmy, I am a virgo, the past two years has been the most difficult years in my life. Is really all about death and rebirth. Some energy is so heavy to handle. I feel very emotional  and anxious and have so much fear at times.  I realized that both relationships  and career got the crumbling tower. Career wise is under rebirth but relationship wise is no where to be seen. But just doing lots of healing of the heart. I hope  to see some more sun coming out .:)

Text: I&#39;m really struggling with what I need to let go of! I feel like I&#39;m in a really good place. I&#39;ve handled my health, been there for others, my kids are super squared away doing what they&#39;ve expressed interest in or graduating from college. I&#39;ve established boundaries at work while still taking on what I can. My husband is awesome, aside from his Leo Mercury making him loud and wrong 🤭<br><br>I&#39;ve put people in touch with each other for job and school opportunities that actually panned out. I&#39;m super happy about that! <br><br>My biggest problem is I can&#39;t find a Le Creuset 5qt braiser at a good price rn 😅 BUT im not gonna over pay. I refuse. Look at how responsible I am Daddy Saturn 😂

I&#39;ve been in part-time school but have completed that with the intention of applying to medical school in the spring. I am a Virgo rising, Gemini sun, Cancer Moon, Taurus Mars, and Cancer Mercury. REALLY love all your videos!!! Thank you for all that you do and sharing your gifts with us!!!

Text: I looked up the Eris placement and unironically it&#39;s an Aries in the 8th as asc Virgo, I legit figured out today 90 or actualy picture perfect information (for now) on how to fix my health, just by food, and I am so glad for this, and I yearn to dig deeper into it. What I find odd is after this b.s, of my b.s as the b.s of b.s happend, and I had no data to chart, and even made one very good connection at an event, and now had to not play that, and saw the upper level again unironcally and the kama of engaging with something that is related to the 9th house and I don&#39;t get it, and I had to realize if I want deeper insights there is no way around than to work on my health and workout, to be a leader in this space even a quiet one mostly, when I was in online chatrooms studying it annoyed me that a lot of people credited my hardwork when I felt I just got started to work on where I wanted to be at again, and it was good till this saviour complex happend and people messaged me commenting on my looks, and I had to realize even in the past work, and feeling out mercury in leo in advance, it&#39;s as if this whole beauty talk finally ends and is enjoyed a bit more, and people still do good work and more technical stuff, I hope... instead of only being inspired, and are more commited to solve problems. For me not trusting my long-term intuition and enduring stuff a bit more is odd, as I see more and have never done this, I get the best choice or one of them and it turns out, I don&#39;t like it, I see leadership this is weak, angry mostly, does not create a strength as a virtue and does his/her best to uphold it and give time, instead it&#39;s like cockatoo&#39;s yearning to slaunter their feathers, and even if that is fine, like solving problems beautifully is different and hard, and mostly not so slauntering and downright ugly at times, yet that can be beautiful, I don&#39;t really get it, as they expected so much and in the end it turned out just to be tedious and it felt unneccessary to the basic depths that are happening and they were making decisions on I was looking into 2023 etc. etc. I really hope I can get into the depth of the pool or engineering work I was in were I can receive the blessing to be carried also by my team and not only do the heavy lifting, due to the limits, and I am pretty sure I will breakthrough some of them with the new health fixes, I really also enjoy the idea of fixing patches in the vision board as well as removing swords bit by bit, I could give a cringe analogy, yet I&#39;d like to embody more yang tiger energy, even if it&#39;s a harm relationship for me, in chinese astrology, and it was something I must&#39;ve cultivated unconsciously and I see the karma a bit etc. etc. I currently do some exercises on trauma, that focus on transcending that and scaled down my routine. So I can work more or have more time for transit if neccessary. I keep gathering images that I want to put into 4o and I want to keep supporting that, I wonder what uranus in the 10th will be, the entire issue is and was this when the stuff happend in august 2023 where I started to meet the ex and got the exact job I was almost dying for. <br><br>The only ones able to support me were strong people, and I was letting them down a bit, due this the neediness, even if the relationship was unique in the end I resented it I can relate to the burning of stuff I had to laugh so hard, I would&#39;ve done worser things to my stuff that was just touched by it, as the entire b.s of karmic elements of her family swapped over and the b.s of my meditation forced them to face truth and me too, and I was quiet frankly not very cautious as I had this very lazi-faire attitude, that I could practically not afford, as they really wanted an a.i hero in work, yet I was new to this stuff besides some smaller introductions. In the end (I did not choose to write the a.i edited message) the person and another person were not good for me as they kept introducting the old pattern I was getting rid out and evolving out of, to a more jet setter type of lifestyle or event based lifestyle I saw at the recent work they had, but with easier work and a way way easier task then coding. etc. I can relate to the burning thing 100% I felt that deeply after this b.s with the ex, and the environment, it would&#39;ve been way better, yet I am not that friendship seeking oriented anymore, I could write more for others to contemplate! But I deleted a long as comment. T<br><br>LDR; I had some key standards that I crossed in order to be with the person and it was odd, yet heck I was meeting so many people that were no good for me, and it was all because of cannabis and the new goverment, in the end I betrayed myself with chaos and even if I wanted the experience I felt the relationship was falling apart, as I am just a normal person then who works hard, and I am freaking exhausted and I felt like I was single-mothering and fathering 4 children (not including the friends), while my mother was fired, operated, sued the employee won the case because of health and bought the companies car, now that is gangster! She is also Virgo asc and even found a better new job that takes her finally to company trips etc., and she even was quiet during this entire b.s. as I kept talking to her about my problems, I was glad she had a new boyfriend, but heck this was such a karmic show I realized it due to charting people in bazi what it was exactly, I leave that out though! Yet I was shocked, and I keep attracting partially these people if my intuition is correct, I am still figuering that out, if some of them are good. Thank you for the reading. Super long comment, thank you for allowing it so far!

Text: If you&#39;re reading this right now, I just want to say; I&#39;m rooting for you. We’re strangers, but that doesn’t mean I don’t care. I know what it’s like to feel like you&#39;re pushing a boulder uphill. I felt that way until I picked up Manifest and Receive by Eva Hartley. I can’t explain it perfectly, but it changed my whole perspective. Since then, things have been flowing—money, peace, confidence. Maybe this is your moment too. Stay open. Wishing you more than you ever imagined. 💫💰
