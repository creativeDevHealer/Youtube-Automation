MY FAVORITE THINGS! 

My Favorite Earthing Mat (Grounding Inside Your Home)
I do grounding/earthing every day outside, but also indoors with earthing mats. This is the only company I trust. I use one while I do your readings (!), I stand on one in my kitchen while I cook, and one by my bed. I recommend the Earthing mats. It‚Äôs the same thing effect as standing on grass, sand or soil, harmonizing your body with the natural frequencies of Earth due to the electron flow ‚Äì you‚Äôre good! https://bit.ly/3QFArUP
