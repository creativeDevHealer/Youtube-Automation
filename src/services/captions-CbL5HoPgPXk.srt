00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, Aries. Thank you so much for

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,200
being members. This is going to be a

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,880
week. All right. And I'm not I'm just

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,480
going to say it. I called it. I called

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,320
it. I knew this was going to be a big

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,640
week for you, but look at what happens.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,240
Like look at all this opportunity and

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,359
this new thing and it just brings you

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,240
back into this like ah I feel

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,359
refreshed. But like Aries 2.0 Oh, now

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,800
this week, by the way, it so when I was

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,359
looking at this week, I was like, it

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,120
really does feel like the beginning of a

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,760
month, it just feels like there's this

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,200
ending beginning. It just So, what we're

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,800
going to do is like what we do for the

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,320
monthly forecast. I'm going to, you

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,000
know, we're going to look at a couple,

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,239
you know, areas of your life and pull

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,200
some cards. Okay. I feel like that felt

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,160
and that's why I did the just I just

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,199
felt like this was more important.

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,000
And again, you do see like you see the

24
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:59,600
it's a big thing. Yeah. All right. So,

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,840
uh are you also by the way are you

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,560
holding on to were you let go of um were

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,840
you let go of a job or you know maybe

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,479
you're you know they cut back or that's

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,080
coming through

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,280
but again it was the best thing for you.

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,200
That's the thing. It's like if you see

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,840
that, if you hold on to that energy like

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,520
I was let go down in the dumps and

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,759
you're in that low frequency energy,

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,400
it's going to be harder. It make you're

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,880
just hard on yourself. But you got to

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,759
see it as like that was meant to be,

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,439
right? So when you vibrate at that

39
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,960
higher frequency, when you are that

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,079
magnet attract and it doesn't have to,

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,520
it can be anything. It could be loving

42
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,439
it. It could be what whatever you want.

43
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,159
Like people that's when people notice

44
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,880
you, you know, they see your light. All

45
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,640
right, let's see what's going on for

46
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,600
love. Actually, let's do love and

47
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,680
relationships first with all this like

48
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,799
sneaky little partnership stuff that

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,159
keeps coming up.

50
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:04,360
Okay, love and relationships for Aries.

51
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,360
I need my um

52
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,039
Okay. Yeah. Two of Pentacles. It just

53
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,360
seems like there's going to be a little

54
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,920
bit of like let's

55
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,440
let's just do what you need to do during

56
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,400
the retrograde. Okay,

57
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,480
go within. All right.

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Uh are y'all Some of y'all may be

59
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,959
between two. You know what I mean? All

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,480
right. So, just with love and

61
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,239
relationships, but some of y'all just

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,480
may be on the fence about something.

63
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,440
Some of y'all just may not know. There's

64
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,080
this kind of like, you know, and not in

65
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,360
a bad way. It's just like because here's

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,120
the thing. Even if you're here watching

67
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,640
for your sun sign, right? I've explained

68
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,000
this. Sometimes it's not about you like

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,680
the aspects that are happening. It's

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,080
about the people in your life that are

71
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,160
important or the circumstances. So, it

72
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,239
does feel like there may just be a point

73
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,599
this week you're at this juncture like

74
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,760
okay and what can we do together that

75
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,920
you know will bring that balance and

76
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,400
harmony into you know our relationship

77
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,200
that makes it feel fun and good. I mean

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,200
you've got Mercury and Leo. You're going

79
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,760
to have the sun in Leo very soon. So,

80
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,239
I'll even clarify that. But there does

81
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,840
feel like

82
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,920
let's bring some I'm going to show you

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,360
something here. Okay. Look at your

84
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:25,680
entire spread. Yeah.

85
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,280
You only got one card that's cups. Okay.

86
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,599
And it's the one where he's leaving

87
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,360
them. So, heart-based living this. Okay.

88
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,519
Really connect with the heart this week.

89
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,519
All right. Just letting you know that

90
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,560
it's a lot of wands. Like you're I told

91
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,440
you you're going to feel something

92
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,680
inside you like like really spirited.

93
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,440
Um okay.

94
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,599
You only got one swords too, right?

95
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,400
Yeah. That's fine. All right. I want to

96
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,400
clarify that two of pentacles.

97
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,280
So if if you are new when you get the

98
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,239
same card from two different uh decks,

99
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,280
you really want to pay attention. Okay.

100
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,599
There's something here. There's

101
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,879
something here with the you got the T of

102
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,000
swords twice and we're talking about

103
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,519
love and relationships. So again, the

104
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,080
biggest thing that's coming up for me is

105
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,079
there's something that you have to it's

106
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,519
the way that you're seeing something.

107
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,440
And the thing is like there may have

108
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,440
been an ending. There may have been

109
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,120
something that may be ending this week.

110
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,560
And I'm not saying it is the actual

111
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,280
relationship. There could be something

112
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,840
that again something that's reached a

113
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,000
point of fatigue. We eat pizza, you

114
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,880
know, every Tuesday. Let's shake it up

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,600
and eat tacos. Whatever it is, there's

116
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,240
got to be some new life into something

117
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,000
here. Okay. But there is something here

118
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,759
where yeah, this week you could feel a

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,080
little bit like a there's something just

120
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,000
not working. Not working. And it could

121
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,240
be you and the way that you're seeing

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,040
something and should something happen to

123
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,639
you in a relationship where you know

124
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,720
there are some conversations and you're

125
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,120
just like, "Oh, I that came out of

126
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,320
nowhere, right?" and I feel a little bit

127
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,639
betrayed and a little you know then

128
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,759
that's when you have to okay ask

129
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,759
yourself what was I meant to learn from

130
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,520
not that conversation but the

131
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,919
conversation not the words that were

132
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,479
said but why did that happen that

133
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,840
circumstance yeah so I know we're going

134
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,639
deep we're going deep but you do have

135
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,479
the north node in your 12th so you're a

136
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,400
fine I'll clarify that for you too okay

137
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,000
10 of sword uh Yeah, have your moment.

138
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,600
It really is all about going within. You

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,880
have the three of cups. Okay, so that's

140
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:41,840
a card of celebration and again three

141
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,840
vibration of the Empress. Okay, do

142
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,840
something new. Shake things up. All

143
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,759
right. Now, um career. And if you're not

144
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:54,360
here for career, let's just we're

145
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,360
calling it career, purpose, or passion.

146
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,320
And it's a it's a big week for that.

147
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:04,639
Yeah. Knight of Swords. Yeah. Okay. Um

148
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:07,039
there's again a little bit of like

149
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,120
the knight of the knight of swords can

150
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,120
be a little impulsive

151
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,039
but the great thing is so just be

152
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,680
mindful of that like just because you're

153
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,520
going to feel so fired up and you have

154
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,639
all these retrogrades asking you to just

155
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,440
let's so here's the thing with this

156
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,240
knight of swords coming up for career.

157
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,400
Go for it. Go for it. Let your mind

158
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,479
roam. Think outside the box, break, have

159
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,000
those breakthroughs, break free, all of

160
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,759
that. All right. You're going to feel

161
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,360
very stimulated and there may be

162
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,039
something that you see that you're just

163
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,039
like, "Okay,

164
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,919
next level.

165
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:46,960
Go after it. Go after it." Okay. But

166
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:49,280
remember, not the best week to like

167
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,880
have important conversations or but if

168
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,960
it's people from the past, yeah, that

169
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,520
could be great. In fact, Knight of

170
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,840
Swords is a Gemini card. Okay. Knight of

171
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,280
swords is Gemini and so there can be

172
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,720
something here with conversations, big

173
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,800
important conversations that you may

174
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,960
have but it just feels more of this

175
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,840
stimulation. Just don't be over,

176
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,960
you know, forceful because he can be a

177
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,479
little bit but this is great. Okay, just

178
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,800
again a lot of stimulation when it comes

179
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,319
to career or purpose or passion. You're

180
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,720
going to have a lot of ideas that you

181
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,240
want to run with now but take time to

182
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,639
map it out. Health. Let's see what's

183
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,639
going on with health.

184
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,160
All right.

185
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,440
Yeah. Okay. Uh, it seems like you're

186
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,000
really good here, but you've got to let

187
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,599
that thing go. All right. I say that

188
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,160
because you got the Ace of Wands. And

189
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,080
when we talk about health, remember, you

190
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,199
have Mars conjuncting the South Node in

191
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,120
Virgo in your sixth house of health. So,

192
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,720
something's got to go. Once it's gone,

193
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,400
you let in the new. Okay. You got the

194
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,039
Ace of Wands and the Page of Wands. All

195
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,960
right. out amazing. So there's this new

196
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,520
chapter for you. There's this, you know,

197
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,280
um that again a lot of sexual energy to

198
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,919
be honest and that could be the thing

199
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,599
that you know whatever it is it's

200
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,000
everything's connected. Physical health,

201
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:11,840
mental health, emotional health, you

202
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
know, once you got to do your thing, but

203
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,759
there is uh you know it's a good time.

204
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,199

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,760

actually really good. It's just that.

241
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,880
Let's just All right, Aries, y'all are

242
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,760
amazing. Thanks. so much. I will see you

243
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,880
next week. Bye-bye. Hi Taurus. Thank you

244
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:56,240
so much for being members. I am so

245
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,720
excited for you. I cannot believe like

246
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,839
this is insane. So what I'm going to do

247
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,440
this week is because when I was looking

248
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,880
at this week, it is one of those weeks

249
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,279
where it just kind of like sneaks up on

250
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,959
you, right? Um because it's, you know, a

251
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,160
few aspects that are happening, but of

252
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,160
course I'm, you know, look at the

253
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,839
asteroids and and and everything else

254
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,000
and I'm just like a little bit more to

255
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,440
this story. And then I take a like I

256
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,079
kind of zoom out a bit. I'm like this is

257
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,680
actually possibly,

258
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,839
you know, between the full moon and the

259
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,760
new moon possibly the most important

260
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,600
week of the month. So um what I'm going

261
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,279
to do is because it does feel like this

262
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,000
like

263
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,480
renewal, this new energy that's coming

264
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,880
through, death to the old, old, out with

265
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,800
the old, in with the new, I'm going to

266
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,160
do uh what I do with a monthly forecast

267
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,760
cuz it it just feels strong. Okay. So,

268
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,120
let's let's look at a couple themes

269
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:52,519
here. We'll pull some cards. All right.

270
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,519
So, let's start with um love

271
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,040
love and relationships for Taurus. You

272
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,320
can expect Okay, you got the knight of

273
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,800
swords. So, there may be something here

274
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,480
with relationships you got to think

275
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,120
about. And I'm not surprised because

276
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,399
again, I was just just the fact that you

277
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,560
have all this 12th house activity. I

278
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,720
just remember the other thing with the

279
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,200
south node in Virgo that's the thing

280
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,760
some of you are going to have

281
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,519
there may be some endings here you know

282
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,200
but it wouldn't be it it just feels like

283
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,800
there yeah with Juno in the mix there

284
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,680
may be some like endings like

285
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,519
relationships it seems very mutual but

286
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:36,880
you know it maybe also if you had for

287
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,360
instance like

288
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,880
friends with benefit situation

289
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,160
And this week you realize like I want to

290
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,360
fall in love. I want to really you know

291
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,720
I want to have a family like things like

292
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,560
that. Like that's what you're letting go

293
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,480
with the Mars South node conjunction.

294
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,120
But whatever it is don't over analyze

295
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,480
things. Don't over just go with your

296
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,079
higher mind, right? That's all you have

297
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,839
to do. All right. So that's the nine of

298
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,800
swords. So with love and relationships,

299
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,160
yeah, there could be something on your

300
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,720
mind, but it just feels like there's

301
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,560
it's not you. It's like someone is

302
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,519
making you feel a certain way. All

303
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,800
right. So remember, Mercury retrogrades,

304
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,240
perfect time to have conversations to,

305
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,480
you know what I mean? Like I said, I

306
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,399
feel like y'all are making up with, you

307
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,120
know, there may be something I I'll

308
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,680
clarify that one for you. So, uh, you've

309
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,079
got the, uh, and remember, when you have

310
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,000
the same, if you're new, if you have the

311
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,399
same card come through from two

312
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,839
different decks, it's you really have to

313
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,600
pay attention. The universe really wants

314
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,320
you to pay attention to this. Okay, you

315
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,880
got the nine of pentacles

316
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,880
twice. Twice. It's in the heart of your

317
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,800
spread. Okay, twice.

318
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,240
So

319
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:47,519
that's two nines. You know what nine is?

320
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,399
It's like endings anyway, right?

321
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,680
Preparing for the new. And you you went

322
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,279
from nine of swords to nine of

323
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,600
pentacles. And the nine of pentacles is

324
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,440
more you anyway, right? It being a

325
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,240
earthbound. So that looks really good.

326
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,160
And remember, she's free to herself. So

327
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,399
whatever's happening here, just free

328
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,160
herself. It can be, it doesn't have to

329
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,000
be the exact relationship. It could be

330
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,040
something that you're thinking about,

331
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,839
okay? Where you're like, if there's

332
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,200
something that you're just like have the

333
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,240
conversations you need to have, free

334
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,920
yourself in any way that you can.

335
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,000
And all that wealth, all that wealth

336
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,120
that waits for you. Okay, so let's see.

337
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,200
Um, let's look at career. That's a big

338
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,120
Let's look at career. And if you're not

339
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:36,320
working, let's call it career,

340
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,320
passion, purpose. Okay. Career, passion,

341
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,320
purpose.

342
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,079
By the way, um Oh, hold on. Let me say

343
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,079
something.

344
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,079
Okay.

345
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,560
Ah, seven of wands. Yeah. You worked

346
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,399
hard to get where you're at. You're not

347
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,839
going to let that the seven of wands is

348
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,839
all about valor. It's all about standing

349
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,720
your ground. It's all about like Yeah.

350
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,120
That don't know. I just went through,

351
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,360
you know, seven years of Uranus in my

352
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,880
sign. You're trying to No, you don't.

353
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,800
So, this is that confidence I was

354
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,199
talking about knowing your worth, not

355
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,399
letting anyone take anything away from

356
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:21,040
you that you worked hard for. Okay?

357
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,760
because that may it may be a thing where

358
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,920
people want what you have because you're

359
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,560
really r literally rising above six of

360
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:33,279
wands seven of wands um what I was going

361
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:36,399
to say is that that nine of pentacles um

362
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:39,760
it's a good indicator of and this is for

363
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,959
love and relationships too but uh or

364
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,000
that's what it was pulled for but

365
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,079
remember it was in the heart of your

366
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,360
spread it's a good indicator of like

367
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:50,360
retirement too okay so uh health

368
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,320
for Taurus sun, moon, and rising. You're

369
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,120
you're you're going to be the rock for

370
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,079
people. You got the emperor. You're

371
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,800
going to be uh like owning who you are.

372
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,800
This is mastery of self. You're good.

373
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,639
You're I mean, he is the ruler of the

374
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,040
land.

375
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,560
He calls the shot. So again with a lot

376
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,519
of fourth house activity and then Saturn

377
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,880
Neptune in your 12th I just feel like

378
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,920
remember what I said earlier that

379
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:25,279
spiritual leader that you know uh role

380
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,800
model the hero energy like yeah oh yeah

381
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,440
do you see why people are looking up at

382
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,839
you like yeah now the last one the

383
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,839
biggest message for t uh Taurus for

384
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,839
tarot

385
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,079
what is the biggest message what should

386
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,079
Taurus really pay attention into this

387
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,079
month.

388
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,560
Seven of cups.

389
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,160
Know what you want. That's all it is.

390
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,759
Know what you want. You do have a lot of

391
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,600
12th house activity and with the north

392
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,079
node in Pisces which rules the 12th

393
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,360
house. And then you know that Virgo

394
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:03,600
Pisces access is uh interesting this

395
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,199
week. But just know what you want.

396
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,279
You're going to be fine. That's the

397
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,399
seven of cups. All right. Um, and it

398
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,480
looks like you might want different

399
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,839
things, but that's why I'm saying uh

400
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,600
have the merging of the physical mind

401
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,600
and the higher mind. Okay, I'll I'll

402
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,399
clarify that seven of cups with. But

403
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,240
that's just really just saying like

404
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:25,000
when you map out your future, make sure

405
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,000
that it's you being your authentic self.

406
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,199
It's no one else like yeah,

407
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,199
four of pentacles. So that's another

408
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,600
thing pay attention to like a big

409
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:39,279
message for you. You're working on the

410
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:42,639
foundations of your life

411
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:46,959
like for real for the next few years

412
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:50,399
building that strong foundation. So

413
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,600
just focus on that too. Okay. And that's

414
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,959
actually really great. I'm glad that the

415
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,720
four of pentacles came out because that

416
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,120
brings a lot of grounded energy. It's

417
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,240
like being very real like realistic,

418
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,600
very practical. It's Yeah. So really

419
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,880
nice. I'm going to clarify the four of

420
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,720
pentacles too. Um, the other reason why

421
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,720
I think it's interesting the four of

422
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,400
pentacles came out is because you did

423
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,000
come after that full moon in Capricorn

424
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,839
last week. So, a lot of it may just be

425
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,280
on your mind anyway. So, it's just

426
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,280
saying like continue to do that. Yeah.

427
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,640
And you have the eight of cups. Okay.

428
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,319
You got to leave something. You know

429
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,720
that. And it just seems like you are

430
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,079
going to Okay. It seems like you are

431
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,080
going to, but a lot of it is when you

432
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,880
have that practicality, when you're like

433
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,559
centered and grounded. Yeah. Eight of

434
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,120
eight of cups. You're like, "Okay, I got

435
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,120
to leave this in the past during the

436
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,960
week of the Mars South conjunction."

437
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,480
Yeah. And that's great because that's

438
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,320
passion. That's power. It's like you

439
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,679
recognizing, remember what I said, it's

440
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,480
all about self worth, self value. You're

441
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,640
recognizing something's better for you.

442
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,320
Amazing. Taurus, you're amazing. All

443
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,960
right. Thanks so much. I will see you

444
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,720
next week. All right. Bye-bye.

445
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,640
Hello, Gemini. Thank you so much for

446
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,440
being members. I'm gonna put my glasses

447
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,440
on. Um,

448
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,440
so

449
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:11,200
okay, here's the thing. If you are new,

450
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,880
one thing that I do sometimes, yeah, I

451
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,440
go directly into these second spreads,

452
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:20,400
but sometimes I just take a quick glance

453
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:23,280
and I get curious. I get curious. So,

454
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,320
let's see. Okay, let's clarify that

455
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,320
tower card. Yep.

456
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:40,640
What is it?

457
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:43,960
What the fax machine?

458
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,960
I can't.

459
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,360
You're good. That was meant for you.

460
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,440
That was meant for you.

461
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,120
You're free. You're free. That Knight of

462
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,840
Cups, you're free to explore. You got to

463
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,840
He's so romantic. He's just oh going out

464
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,559
there. Very dreamy energy, dreamer

465
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,039
energy. You got the north node in Pisces

466
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,120
trying them. You got He's Pisces by the

467
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,520
way. So much creative energy that I told

468
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,160
you about. Yeah, he's got the wings of

469
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,320
imagination on his helmet and his shoes.

470
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,000
So little bit of Mercury here too.

471
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,919
Remember you got Mercury and Leo in your

472
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,799
third. Anyway, do you remember last week

473
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,120
when I did this in the bonus spread too

474
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,039
for I forget what it was, but I I was

475
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,559
curious about something in your spread.

476
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,360
You got that the Knight of Cups. So,

477
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,440
there is something here with

478
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,640
partnerships, relationships. Um, there's

479
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,760
something here about you pursuing

480
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,200
something that's going to emotionally

481
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,400
fulfill you. And you see that here with

482
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,320
that King of Cups. That's where you want

483
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,559
to be.

484
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,880
Okay.

485
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,360
Best thing for you. All right. So

486
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,200
because of this week because it for me

487
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,000
it just feels like the death and rebirth

488
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,360
of something for every sign. There's

489
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,360
something un there's just something rare

490
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,840
that's happening this week. The way the

491
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,200
asteroid everything between the full

492
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,960
moon from last week and the new moon

493
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,240
next week. I just feel this is a really

494
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,919
strong week. Let's see what's going on

495
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,240
for So I'm going to do what I'm doing is

496
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,480
I'm pulling cards for just kind of how I

497
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,520
do the monthly forecast. Yeah. All

498
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,919
right. So let's uh let's do love first.

499
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,919
I'm going to see love, love and

500
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,919
relationships

501
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,000
for Gemini sun, moon, and rising. So,

502
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,080
uh, yeah, there you go. There's

503
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,919
something here that you've got to that

504
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,480
might be it

505
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:32,559
or that 10 of wands. That might be it.

506
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,200
Just to FYI.

507
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,799
And 10 of Wands is a third deck and a

508
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,520
Sagittarius. Sagittarius card.

509
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:41,600
Sagittarius rules your seventh house of

510
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,760
partnerships and relationships. And

511
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,320
Queen of Swords is Libra, by the way.

512
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,559
And Libra is the ruler of the seventh

513
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,480
house of partnerships and relationships

514
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,600
out. There may be something here that's

515
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,600
got to end. Okay? And again, it doesn't

516
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,440
have to be the relationship when it

517
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,720
comes to love and relationships. It

518
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,080
could be a way that maybe you are it's

519
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,200
something that you want and you're just

520
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,520
working so much. But ask yourself, am I

521
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,520
doing this

522
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,760
like for a reason? Yeah. Do I have to

523
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,200
recognize that's the thing that's got to

524
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,200
go? Is me sabotaging myself when it

525
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,520
comes to love and relationships? There's

526
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,520
something there where, you know, I want

527
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,360
it, but I'm not taking action for it.

528
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,520
I'm just going to work a lot and that's

529
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,360
my excuse. Do you know what I mean? So,

530
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,640
just keep that in mind. And again, every

531
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,559
all of y'all are different. You're going

532
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,520
to but at the end of the day that's the

533
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,120
10 of wands. You drop a wand or two. You

534
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,720
can see a little clearly. So you see

535
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,960
that like with that coming up the tower

536
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,440
here it just feels like there is you

537
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,520
have all this like free fun social

538
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,960
magnetic all of that but there is

539
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:52,080
something that's just like has to go and

540
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:56,200
are you recognizing it? Yeah. So I'll

541
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,200
clarify that 10 of wands for you.

542
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,880
You got two of them.

543
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:11,679
So, yeah, I just address it.

544
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,440
Okay. Any bottlenecks or anything that

545
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,600
feels

546
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,200
heavy

547
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,880
that'll lighten your load. You got the

548
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,320
King of Cups. If you're new, when you

549
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,480
get the same card from two different

550
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,679
decks, you got to really pay attention.

551
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,520
You really want that emotional

552
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,760
stability. And we're talking about cups,

553
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,440
which is love and relationships. You

554
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:34,000
won't be sitting in that throne. All

555
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:36,960
right. With your boo, two of wands.

556
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,440
Okay. So, again, another card that's

557
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,600
just saying, hey,

558
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:46,080
plan things out, map things out, look at

559
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:48,880
your future. How does this fit? Yeah.

560
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,960
How are you going to make room?

561
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,960
Or however you want to do what you want

562
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,960
to do with that magician that keeps

563
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,080
sticking to my elbow. Let's see what's

564
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,159
going on for um career purpose or

565
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,400
passion

566
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,480
because if you're not working Yeah.

567
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,360
won't focus on your like as if if you're

568
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,360
retired or whatnot. So career purpose or

569
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,360
passion.

570
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,919
There it is. I want to see this card

571
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,400
too. All right. So

572
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,400
let's see. Uh you have the six of

573
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,080
pentacles. Very nice. Very good. Very

574
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,760
good when it comes to career. That looks

575
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:28,320
great. And

576
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,799
you got the sun. Very good. Very

577
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,679
amazing. You're good. I tell you, your

578
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:36,640
career is like bonkers. Okay. Six of

579
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,559
pentacles. That's just amazing. That's,

580
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,799
you know, if you're seeking support,

581
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,120
it's coming. You've got support all

582
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,400
around you. There's this sense of like,

583
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,320
you know what I talked about like cause

584
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,799
and effect. There's a sense of like

585
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,200
taking that inspired action. You'll see

586
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,880
how much that changes your world. All

587
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,360
right? And you really feel that with

588
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,360
that six of pentacles. And so yeah,

589
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,760
that's wealth. But wealth comes in so

590
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,840
many different forms. Okay. And then you

591
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,880
have the sun. What did I talk about? The

592
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,039
queen of wands in the heart of your

593
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,760
spread. The sun being the biggest yes in

594
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,440
tarot, by the way. So things look really

595
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,679
good. You have that full abundance. The

596
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,960
sun. It feels like there's some It feels

597
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,039
like there's something here that's just

598
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,640
like setting you up to have a lot of

599
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,400
power, but like have fun with it, too.

600
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,720
Remember, the sun is optimism. It's

601
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,960
vitality. It's opportunities.

602
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,880
It's a cleansing. It's a lot. It's your

603
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,880
good. Now, let's look at health.

604
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,840
All right, Gemini.

605
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,440
King of Wands. Um, you're getting all

606
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,440
these leaders. You got the King of Cups,

607
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:52,400
Queen of Cups. Um, yeah. So, uh, the

608
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,720
King of Wands, I mean, you got the King

609
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,559
and the Queen. So, the King of Wands

610
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,880
when it comes to health, just you're

611
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,760
going to feel very spirited.

612
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,360
That raises your frequency. That King of

613
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,679
Wands, so much fiery energy. And again,

614
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,600
this week, you're going to you're you're

615
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,760
busy. You're busy. You're social. You're

616
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,679
networking. And that's a King of Wands.

617
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,840
He is very social, too. And he is, you

618
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,640
know, the entrepreneur. He's the fun

619
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,640
king as well. So it's when you have that

620
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,600
joy in your life, all that passion in

621
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,960
your life that affects all like mental

622
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,720
health, emotional health, physical

623
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:32,320
health, all of it. Okay. So have that

624
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,640
passion, feel that passion.

625
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,799
Do not deny yourself of that passion.

626
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:41,400
Now, uh

627
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,400
what is the biggest message for Gemini?

628
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,400
All right.

629
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,799
I kind was trying to guess. Um, I got

630
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,520
close, but you got the knight of swords.

631
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:10,400
You got your card. So, the biggest

632
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,000
message, slow down.

633
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,360
There's going to be it seems like you're

634
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,799
going to be very social. You're it's a

635
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,799
Knight of Wands. But what's really great

636
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,799
about this, like I said, there's a lot

637
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:23,279
of confident boosting energy that's

638
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,960
happening in your sign this week. The

639
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,640
Knight of Swords. Remember what I said

640
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,200
about like fear being fiction. Like he's

641
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,279
fearless. He goes into the storm. He

642
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,080
gets what he wants. It's the sword. So,

643
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,919
it's a very cerebral. It's also like

644
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,919
communicative. It's getting what you

645
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,760
want through conversations.

646
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,240
You're the Geminis's anyway. You're good

647
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,480
at that, being persuasive,

648
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,159
all of that. So, there may be something

649
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,159
here that yeah, your biggest message is

650
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,080
being the messenger with that knight of

651
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,679
swords. You could be delivering a

652
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,880
message, but there's a lot going on

653
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,039
through your mind. But that's why I'm

654
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,799
saying slow down because he can go a

655
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,320
little fast. He can be a little

656
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:03,279
impulsive.

657
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,640
And normally I would be like go go go

658
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,159
forth, go with the wind. But with all

659
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:11,039
these retrogrades that are asking you

660
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:13,360
to, you know, try not to like,

661
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,880
okay, because you're going to see that

662
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,919
with your mind's going really fast and

663
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,000
you want to take action, you want to do

664
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,520
this, you want to do this, when all the

665
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,960
energy is trying to just pull you back a

666
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:26,559
little bit, just a little bit, okay? You

667
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:30,000
can still do things, but just make sure

668
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,520
that you still take action. That's the

669
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,960
biggest message, okay? Just continue to

670
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,960
take action. Just try not to be like

671
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,720
very impulsive. You got that Knight of

672
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,960
Cups. I mean, Knights are all about

673
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,039
action, by the way. They have a drive

674
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,960
and purpose. And so, you're going to

675
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,039
feel very driven this week. You're going

676
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,640
to feel very driven. You're amazing.

677
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,039
Thanks so much, Gemini. I will see you

678
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,120
next week. All right. Bye-bye. Hello,

679
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,080
Cancer. Thank you so much for being

680
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,840
members. Um, listen, this is going to be

681
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,159
a week.

682
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,559
It's a great week again. It just feels

683
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,919
like big. It feels big. It feels there's

684
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:08,399
like something major happening. But

685
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,640
again, Mars conjuncting uh the south

686
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,679
node is also going to be really big too

687
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,360
because there's going to be something

688
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,960
here.

689
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,640
Again,

690
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,559
sometimes there are things that you

691
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,120
don't want to let go, but Mars is going

692
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:23,679
to be like you got it. But Juno's in the

693
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,159
mix, too. So Juno's, you know, helping

694
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:29,520
you saying, "Okay, let's talk about

695
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:33,840
this. Maybe even compromise."

696
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:37,840
But yeah, I do have to recognize this is

697
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:39,919
I've learned my lesson. Okay. Um,

698
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,919
so what I'm doing, you hear the church

699
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,919
bells.

700
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,720
Okay. So, what I'm doing for you now is

701
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,440
I'm just going to do what I usually do

702
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,799
for the monthly forecast because there's

703
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:00,080
so much happening in terms of all this

704
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:02,960
new energy, but then all this retrograde

705
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,360
energy. So, I really wanted to see where

706
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,320
we're at now

707
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,520
with certain themes, okay, in your life.

708
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:14,080
So, we're going to start with love,

709
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:16,240
okay? Love and um

710
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:21,320
I'm going to look at those later. uh

711
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,320
love and relationships for cancer,

712
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,440
okay? Because you do have that new moon

713
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,760
coming up. Uh there's just so much other

714
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,559
stuff. Like I said, July is bonkers,

715
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,799
okay? Love and relationships. Oh, okay.

716
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,159
Eight of Pentacles. So, um biggest thing

717
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,159
that's coming through is patience.

718
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,720
Practice patience. There's a sense of

719
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,960
you working on something, okay? Or you

720
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,799
need to work on something, but take that

721
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,120
time for you. I feel like there's

722
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,360
something again when you're in touch

723
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:53,120
with your intuition and with Uranus in

724
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,840
your 12th house again very even healing

725
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,360
energy. Don't forget Chiron's in the mix

726
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,799
too. But there we're talking about love

727
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,240
and relationships. You have the eight of

728
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,320
pentacles. It's building towards

729
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,399
something. Okay? Working together,

730
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,919
building towards something, okay? Even

731
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,399
if you're single, building towards

732
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,039
something. Even if you have to like put

733
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,559
out a PowerPoint, you know, deck for

734
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,840
yourself. Again, I'm not even joking.

735
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,720
with all these planets retrograde and

736
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,600
you got Mars and Virgo which again very

737
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,480
detail oriented very like perfectionist

738
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,960
energy but that's other thing with Mars

739
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,080
in the south end Virgo try not to be

740
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,960
overcritical overly perfectionist energy

741
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,880
that can happen and it could be the way

742
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,919
that you're communicating with people as

743
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,360
well it is your third house all right

744
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,600
let's take a look at these cards there

745
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,720
was a bunch that fell out for you know

746
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:46,720
love when the when the church bells

747
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:49,279
Okay. King of uh pentacles

748
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,520
with that eight of pentacles. Four of

749
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:55,039
swords. Mhm.

750
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,880
Stillness of mind. Yeah. Temperance.

751
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,600
Pretty much the same thing. You have a

752
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,720
lot here saying patience,

753
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:06,799
patience. That's it. That's your biggest

754
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,960
takeaway. Okay. Have that patience.

755
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:12,159
Stay grounded. Well, there's pentacle

756
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:15,600
energy and then temperance, which is

757
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:17,440
enjoy the moment, okay? Don't get all

758
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,799
swept up in here. Remember, that's going

759
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:24,320
to be for some of y'all. Yeah, just have

760
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:28,240
that patience. It is a time with the

761
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,880
prison portal as well as for retrogrades

762
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,279
and Mercury going retrograde. All right.

763
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,120
Now, um

764
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,679
that's so that's your big message. Now,

765
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:42,000
let's take a look at your career. Okay.

766
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:43,840
Let's say career, purpose, passion. Yep.

767
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:49,240
If you're retired or not working,

768
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,240
career, purpose, passion for cancer.

769
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,960
All right. Ah, you and all your

770
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,080
pentacles. 10 of pentacles again, career

771
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,760
is the biggest highlight. You have

772
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,720
Saturn and Neptune there. Okay. In your

773
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:05,600
10th, you're really figuring out like

774
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,840
what's real for me. I would you know uh

775
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,679
if anything was like fantasy right with

776
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,240
Neptune retrograde anything that was

777
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,720
fantasy it's like let's we got to pull

778
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,120
ourselves out of that but that's great

779
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,080
10 of pentacles for career there's there

780
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:22,320
is that finish line it looks really good

781
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,480
okay 10 of pentacles is legacy it's a

782
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,159
you made it card and remember the ride

783
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,919
await smith deck it's like the pentacles

784
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,760
raining from the heavens and this card

785
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,279
is actually attributed to Mars and Virgo

786
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,679
can you believe that and then you have

787
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,679
Mars and Virgo comes into the South

788
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,600
node. So once again when I just see

789
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,000
what's happening for you that just seems

790
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,640
like there's a big change. All right.

791
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,720
Now let's see in a good way with that

792
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,120
and not only astrologically but with

793
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,000
that T of pentacles. Now let's see uh

794
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,679
health. Okay. Virgo does rule like

795
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,200
health,

796
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,559
mental health, emotional health,

797
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,200
physical health, social health,

798
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,840
spiritual health.

799
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:05,760
Is all right. Cancer sun, moon, and

800
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,039
rising. Oh,

801
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,960
there's a lot of cards that want to come

802
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,600
out. Okay, let's go that one and I'll

803
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,519
take a look at those.

804
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,320
Judgement. All right, so there is

805
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,399
definitely something here. You have to

806
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,080
wake up. I'm not saying you're not

807
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,880
awake.

808
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,720
A lot of the cards that came out is

809
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,399
like, and again, you have Uranus in your

810
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,919
12th. You have the North Node in your

811
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,679
9inth.

812
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,240
There is something here. You can't

813
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,840
forget about Pluto in your eighth. Yeah,

814
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,399
this card actually judgment is

815
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,320
attributed to Pluto. This is the wakeup

816
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,440
call, spiritual awakening. Some of

817
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,360
youall getting a second chance at

818
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,960
something too. Um, and that is going to

819
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,480
make the difference when you actually

820
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,840
have that breakthrough, when you see the

821
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,360
thing that you have to see, when you

822
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,760
make that change that you need to make.

823
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,519
Okay? So, just keep that in mind. All

824
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,480
right. I'm going to pull one from from

825
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,480
these that came out uh when it comes to

826
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,200
health because that when I say that

827
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,840
that's what fixes not fixes but like

828
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,720
improves mental health, emotional

829
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,800
health, physical they're all connected.

830
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,000
There's some some big thing that you've

831
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,960
got to see. Okay. It's got to come

832
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,720
within you. All right. I want to do this

833
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:21,679
one. Yeah. You got the high priestess.

834
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,159
So there's your affirmation. Go within.

835
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,000
Go within. But be in touch with your

836
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,599
intuition. There are some things that

837
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,119
you can't see, Cancer. But if you go

838
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,320
within,

839
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,720
oh, you can see, okay? When you when you

840
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,800
really dive in that intuitive energy,

841
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,639
okay, remember he's got his hands over

842
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:45,440
his face. These two are, you know,

843
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,760
chained to the devil. So, they're like,

844
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,639
and then you got the seven of cups. He

845
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,960
can't. It's all foggy.

846
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,280
You got to go within. All right. Now,

847
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,720
the pay special attention to card. What

848
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:01,520
should Cancer pay special attention to

849
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,800
this week.

850
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,040
Your biggest message would be

851
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,560
four of pentacles.

852
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,240
Look at that. Stability, structure,

853
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,839
working on the foundations of your life.

854
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,119
That's what Jupiter exalted in your sign

855
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:19,280
is anyway. So, keep doing you. And don't

856
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,160
forget the like fundamentals. Don't

857
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,119
forget even like who you are and the

858
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,680
world that you want to build for

859
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,640
yourself. Okay. Four of Pentacles is

860
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,520
also like don't let things get like just

861
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,400
be on top of everything. Be on top of

862
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,320
everything and don't let circumstances

863
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,160
own you, right? Remember there is a

864
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,200
sense of you becoming a lot more

865
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,640
confident this week. Use it. Okay. But a

866
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,960
lot of it here with all these swords

867
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,440
too. It's like it's going to help right

868
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,440
here. Let's move in this new direction.

869
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,160
Remember, all this is just potential,

870
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,599
too. So, if you move in that direction

871
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,599
of that high frequency, you're going to

872
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,920
be 1,000% fine. But there is that

873
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,320
potential like, okay, did I make the

874
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,760
right choice or someone did something to

875
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,000
me and now that got in my way. Why would

876
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,640
you let anyone take your power, right?

877
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,160
And that's you can be standing your

878
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,040
ground for that. But there's still

879
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:16,000
something here that's like, okay, let me

880
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:18,160
continue to work on these. Work on me

881
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,160
during these retrogrades

882
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,760
and I'll know and I'll have that moment

883
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,640
of clarity, that spiritual awakening

884
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:30,079
that I'm seeking. It's you're actually

885
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:31,839
really good to be honest. Just don't um

886
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,480
you just got to see something in a

887
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:36,320
different way. That's all it is. Okay?

888
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,320
And I truly believe you will with the

889
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,440
Uranus and your 12th. Cancer, y'all are

890
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,359
amazing. Happy birthday. I will see you.

891
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,160
And yeah, big things to come. You want

892
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:48,480
to see the Let's see. Yeah. Let's see

893
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,240
with the world. You got that eight of

894
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,800
swords. That's what it is. That's what

895
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,240
it is. You're moving into something new.

896
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,640
You could have already started planning

897
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,440
it. Now, these retrogrades is like

898
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:04,079
you're you're like doubting yourself and

899
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,520
you're you see that, right? Do not.

900
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,839
And that's what happens when we move

901
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,599
into new places in our life for new

902
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:12,480
directions, new job, new relationship.

903
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:15,920
There can be a little bit of that. Don't

904
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,680
don't do that. Yeah, you got the moon.

905
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,320
I'm going do one more. There's something

906
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:23,599
here that uh six of wands. That's really

907
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,839
great. Yeah. So,

908
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,680
I'm going to let me just do one more. We

909
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,000
got that four of swords again. So, do

910
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,640
you see what's happening here? Something

911
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,160
new. Something that even new that hasn't

912
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,800
even happened yet. something that you

913
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,320
want to do but there is a sense of like

914
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,400
with all these retrogrades you're going

915
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,480
within a lot of the past coming back

916
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,079
there can be something here where it's

917
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,320
part of that south node it's just like

918
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,520
because it's in your third again third

919
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:52,079
is the mind right so there's something

920
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,079
here it seems like it's a test for you

921
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,520
that's all it is you can see that

922
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,079
clearly there's something here testing

923
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,560
you and

924
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,880
you can pass you that six of wands you

925
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,800
got that four of swords things are

926
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,119
happening fastaster past for you. You're

927
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,440
going to be good. It's just it really is

928
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,760
saying the only thing that get in your

929
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,839
way would be yourself of here. Don't

930
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,200
over analyze. Don't overthink. Go with

931
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,640
the flow. Flow with the go. And know

932
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,280
that everything that's happening is

933
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:22,240
leading you toward everything that you

934
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,520
want. You got to you got to lead the way

935
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,760
though. All right. You got to be that

936
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,680
leader. Anyway, Cancer, you are those

937
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,359
you are that leader. Six of Wands really

938
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,960
great. That card actually is attributed

939
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:34,720
to Jupiter in in Leo. And so remember

940
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,480
Jupiter is actually moving into Leo next

941
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:41,359
year while we have the eclipses in in

942
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:45,440
Leo and Jupiter will trine Saturn and

943
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:48,480
Aries. That is just insane for you. I've

things, okay? And let the things go that

954
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,640

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:24,960
members, y'all. I'm going to That was

960
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:27,520
bonk. Like, I can't even I can't um

961
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,839
wow. I just can't. It's like everything

962
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,240
that you want you're going to have. But

963
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:34,560
it really is that patience part. And I

964
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,839
do have to remind you and it's again I

965
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,839
was going to talk more about this next

966
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,520
week, but when the sun moves into your

967
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,440
sign with Mercury in your sign and there

968
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,119
are going to be a little you know some

969
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,520
aspects that are you know next week just

970
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,000
be mindful of remember the lure

971
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,680
expression of you know some aspects

972
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,440
happening in your sign as Leo can be

973
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,839
like pride and ego. Okay. So, just bear

974
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,680
that in mind because there's a lot with

975
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:02,800
Mercury retrograde in Leo. Yeah, there's

976
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,720
a lot of like my way, nope, my way.

977
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,800
Nope, my way. With other people and

978
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,520
you're going to be so social. All right,

979
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,480
keep that in mind. But, um, this is

980
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:17,560
amazing. Um, you're good. You're

981
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,560
absolutely good. I can't even like

982
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,839
I just did not expect that. Like, you're

983
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:26,240
really really really good. Okay. So,

984
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:29,599
Leo, what I'm going to do is that um

985
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,920
I wanted to do just because where we are

986
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,520
right now, like mid July, after

987
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,680
everything that we went through the

988
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,000
first two weeks of July and what you're

989
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:42,800
about to experience this week and then

990
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,480
next week, it really does feel like this

991
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,160
is a strong week. So, I'm going to treat

992
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,680
this like a monthly forecast. I'm going

993
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,520
to pull cards for love, career, health,

994
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,359
all of that. Like your biggest message.

995
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,280
So, let's break it down. Okay. So, let's

996
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:58,280
look at love and relationships first.

997
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,280
Okay.

998
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:04,319
Leo sun, moon, and rising because it

999
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:07,119
feels like a reset to be honest. Um, you

1000
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:09,760
got another three three of pentacles.

1001
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:12,079
Uh, that's really great. So, remember I

1002
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,359
said love and relationships. There's

1003
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,359
remember pentacles are your physical

1004
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,440
reality, your physical realm. This card

1005
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:20,560
really is about all about working with

1006
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:25,040
others, teamwork. Let's see eye to eye.

1007
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:27,520
Let's build this together. Okay. And

1008
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,680
that is where you really feel that like

1009
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,839
spirit of consciousness.

1010
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,079
This is actually

1011
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,440
really amazing. Okay.

1012
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,480
really good because it looks like there

1013
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,480
is either something that you're it feels

1014
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,640
a lot for a lot of y'all like rebuilding

1015
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,880
or want to rebuild or want to move in a

1016
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,400
different direction or you're just

1017
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,599
entering a new part like something new.

1018
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:56,160
Remember this is creation. Yeah, the

1019
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:59,040
Empress you got death change. Okay. And

1020
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,640
so there's something here new that's

1021
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,240
happening in your life when it comes to

1022
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,880
love relationships. It could be the way

1023
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:07,040
that you're seeing, you know, current

1024
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,560
relationships, how you've perceived

1025
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,680
relationships,

1026
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,440
changing the way that you see

1027
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,000
relationships with Uranus and Gemini

1028
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,400
with Mercury retrograde in your sign.

1029
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Okay? Or working or you know building

1030
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,040
something with someone from the past.

1031
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,640
Now let's see career. Okay. And let's

1032
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,400
say career, purpose or passion or and

1033
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:31,079
yeah, if you're not working, if you're

1034
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,079
retired, career, purpose, passion,

1035
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:40,880
Leo, uh, five of pentacles.

1036
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:44,000
So there you go. Do you see how that

1037
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,599
explains a lot here? Yeah, there's, like

1038
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,680
I said, a lot of y'all are changing jobs

1039
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,240
or it's already happened. That's the

1040
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,160
other thing. If there was a circumstance

1041
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,319
where you didn't see it coming or you

1042
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,880
know what I mean like maybe your team

1043
00:42:54,319 --> 00:43:00,480
was laid off or you you know maybe a

1044
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:03,280
client left or whatever don't

1045
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,400
hold on to that energy it had nothing to

1046
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,920
do with you. Yeah. Don't create this

1047
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,280
whole Yeah. That's that five of

1048
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,599
pentacles. That's what it's saying.

1049
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,240
You're moving into new things anyway. I

1050
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:17,119
gave you like five reasons why you have

1051
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,680
a lot to look forward to. Okay. So this

1052
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,160
is a little bit of like um yeah there's

1053
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:24,960
something that's happening uh career

1054
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,599
purpose passion where you may feel like

1055
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,000
some there's a slowdown or something's

1056
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,319
holding you back or there's something

1057
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,680
here where it's

1058
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:36,720
there could have been a circumstance

1059
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:40,079
that put you in place of like

1060
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:42,400
but remember the five of pentacles it's

1061
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,839
all about there's this sanctuary all

1062
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,960
around you all you have to do is reach

1063
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:50,240
out okay these people are outside the

1064
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:53,200
church then they refuse to go in. So

1065
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:56,880
there's this element of focusing on

1066
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,960
their plight and their woes rather than

1067
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,960
like taking charge doing something like

1068
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,400
get changing your life right so just

1069
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,000
keep that in mind okay so should

1070
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,520
something happen remember there's

1071
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,119
something amazing on the other side you

1072
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,960
have death with the empress there's

1073
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,400
something absolutely amazing okay um so

1074
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,200
a lot of y'all want to make changes

1075
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:20,160
anyway so just don't doubt yourself

1076
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,160
either okay I'll yeah I'll clarify

1077
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,280
Uh yeah, there you go. You got the

1078
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,640
devil.

1079
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,720
You got to let it go. There's something

1080
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,240
here. You got to make sure that you see

1081
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,960
what it is. You got the moon in your

1082
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,640
crown. The devil. So, a lot of this is

1083
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,079
subconscious energy. What is the

1084
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,680
subconscious is where we store our

1085
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:41,280
memories.

1086
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:42,640
What is that? Past. What is happening

1087
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,079
this week? You got four planets

1088
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,560
retrograde. You got Mercury retrograde

1089
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,800
in your sign. The past. Okay. So,

1090
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:51,119
there's something that you're chained to

1091
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,119
that's making you think a certain way

1092
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:56,000
when something happens or even in a

1093
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:58,240
situation that could happen this week.

1094
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,119
No, that would be that devil energy,

1095
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,280
that trickery energy. Yeah, they're

1096
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,720
taking your energy.

1097
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,760
So, you got to break free from the

1098
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:10,160
chains, whatever it is, and then you're

1099
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,800
set free. Remember, you got a lot to

1100
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:16,680
look forward to. Okay? And I'm going to

1101
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,680
show you something here, by the way.

1102
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:24,000
It's the same people, the same thing.

1103
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,640
It's the same thing. Okay, you see that,

1104
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,200
right? Knight of Cups and uh the Death

1105
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,760
card. So, it's almost like you're

1106
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,520
manifesting something that you want, but

1107
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,920
you can't doubt yourself. That that's

1108
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,200
where it gets a little just don't doubt

1109
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,400
yourself. Remember, I said this is a

1110
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,800
week where you're focusing on

1111
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,400
confidence. You have Mars conjunct the

1112
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,480
south node in your second house of self

1113
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,040
worth and self value. If you don't see

1114
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:49,520
yourself, you know, in a place where,

1115
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,680
you know, I deserve a raise or I deserve

1116
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:54,000
this or this is, you know what I mean?

1117
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,640
Like then, yeah, that that would keep

1118
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,040
you in that low energy frequency. So,

1119
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,560
just ask that's why you have to go

1120
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:04,240
within. You got to figure out what it is

1121
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:06,000
to let it go and release it. Okay? Now,

1122
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,240
and pay attention to your dreams. Now,

1123
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,400
the third thing is uh health. Let's look

1124
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,400
at health.

1125
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:21,599
All right, Leo. H you got the world. I'm

1126
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:24,880
getting a little bit of uh world on your

1127
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:27,359
shoulder energy. Yeah, there's something

1128
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:31,680
ending the world, right? Being the end

1129
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:33,920
of the uh major. Yeah. Uh arcana, the

1130
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,160
fool's journey. Do you remember your

1131
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,160
reading from last week? You got the

1132
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:41,839
magician and the fool. So you got like

1133
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:45,839
this new. So anyway, it just feels like

1134
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:48,640
there's it's a patience thing as well.

1135
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:50,800
Practice patience. You see everything's

1136
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:54,640
about to change for you. Don't doubt

1137
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:57,680
yourself. Uh be able to, you know, see

1138
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:00,960
the changes happening in your life. Um

1139
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:03,280
and enjoy it. Enjoy life. I mean this is

1140
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,680
amazing but at the same time it does

1141
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,839
feel a little bit of like there could be

1142
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,480
this disconnect

1143
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,760
mind body spirit all together put it all

1144
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,760
together and I'm just saying that here

1145
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:17,040
with with how this is laid out but I

1146
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,760
love that it's just again showing that

1147
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,599
once you take that burden off yourself

1148
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,000
and remember we're talking about health

1149
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,400
that improves mental health physical

1150
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,119
health emotional health all of it

1151
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:32,079
spiritual health so be proud of

1152
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:34,319
yourself. Okay, be proud of yourself.

1153
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,640
You made it to the end. You got this

1154
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:38,480
amazing new and even if you don't know

1155
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,960
what it's like and that makes you a

1156
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,400
little you're good. You got all this

1157
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,839
abundance leadership all of that. You're

1158
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,960
good. All right. Now, the biggest

1159
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:47,960
message for Leo would be

1160
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:56,560
this would be the pay special attention

1161
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:58,960
to card. What should Leo pay? Yeah.

1162
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:01,440
Uh, I don't know why I did that, but if

1163
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,680
you're new, when you get the same card

1164
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,560
from two different decks, that's over

1165
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,920
170 cards, you know, the universe is

1166
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:11,119
trying to tell you something, especially

1167
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,440
for the pay special attention to card.

1168
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:16,560
The biggest message,

1169
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:19,119
three of wands. Okay, so pay special

1170
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:21,839
attention to this. Two things. one.

1171
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:26,559
Yeah, there's something here where it's

1172
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:30,000
like you've got to get out of um

1173
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:32,720
it's like an ambivalence. Okay. Also

1174
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,160
being hard on yourself. These they're

1175
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:38,319
ready to go. They're ready to go, but

1176
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:40,559
you got to know when that green light is

1177
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:42,640
lit for you. Okay. Remember Mercury's

1178
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,440
retrograde and it doesn't mean you can't

1179
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:48,720
start new things but at least take the

1180
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:51,760
time this week with Mars conjunct Virgo

1181
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,520
because that will clear a lot of energy.

1182
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,280
March conjunct the south node in Virgo

1183
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,400
that'll clear a lot of energy and bring

1184
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:00,559
a lot more clarity. Yeah. And it's it's

1185
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,640
it's it's a lot of weight off your

1186
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:05,839
shoulder. All right. whatever you

1187
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,920
release. But if there's anything, you

1188
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:10,240
are getting a green light. This is

1189
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,000
indicating you're about to embark on

1190
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,839
this brand new journey, this brand new

1191
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,839
era.

1192
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:17,359
Be prepared, though. And to be prepared,

1193
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:20,480
you got to have that. You have to go

1194
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:21,599
within. Okay, Leos, y'all are amazing. I

1195
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,319
will see you next week. All right.

1196
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:27,520
Bye-bye. Hello, Virgo. Thank you so much

1197
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:30,160
for being members. Um, listen. So, what

1198
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,000
I'm doing for you this week is that I'm

1199
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:35,680
not doing a spread, but because this

1200
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,640
week feels so much like a death and

1201
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,079
rebirth, right, for every sign with Mars

1202
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,839
on the south node, with all these

1203
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,720
retrogrades, with people thinking about

1204
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:46,640
the new new them, with the prism portal.

1205
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,640
Um, what I'm going to do is what I

1206
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,720
usually do for the monthly forecast. I

1207
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,200
want to do a check-in. Okay? So, we're

1208
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,520
going to look at a couple themes. Okay?

1209
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,280
We're going to pull some cards here. And

1210
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,960
the first we're going to start with is

1211
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:02,480
love and relationship. So, what can

1212
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:05,480
Virgo expect this week? Yeah, love and

1213
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,480
relationships.

1214
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:13,119
What was it?

1215
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:16,160
And if you're new, by the way,

1216
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:19,520
um when you get the same card from two

1217
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:21,040
different decks, that's over 160 cards.

1218
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,319
You know that the universe is telling

1219
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,599
you something here and you really want

1220
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:25,520
to pay attention. So when it comes to

1221
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:28,000
love and relationships, you got the King

1222
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,800
of Pentacles twice. Okay. Now, here's

1223
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,280
the thing, Virgo. Yeah, this is a big

1224
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,200
focus on being that, you know, in a

1225
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,559
relationship. You want to be there. You

1226
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,240
want to be present. You want to show up.

1227
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,559
You even want to show up for yourself to

1228
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,640
show up. Okay. But there is a sense of

1229
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,480
like feeling that comfort, feeling that

1230
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:47,200
wealth in relationships where it's like,

1231
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,839
I'm good. I'm good. I feel free as well.

1232
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,680
This feels really good. and you've built

1233
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:53,280
something here that you can be very

1234
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,359
proud of or you're in the process of

1235
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,200
building something, right? This is

1236
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,559
saying go do it. Go build. If you're

1237
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,440
single, go do it. Go build that. If

1238
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,079
you're in a relationship where you're

1239
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,720
like, what you got to do to feel

1240
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:07,280
protected? Yeah. What do you have to do?

1241
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:09,599
Okay. Where you also want to be that

1242
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,760
person that is a provider too. It's all

1243
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:14,319
about, you know, sharing the wealth. All

1244
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,599
right? So, keep that in mind. But at the

1245
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:19,119
end of the day, there is something here

1246
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:21,520
where it's like this is wealth. His his

1247
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:24,319
robe is integrated with the harvest.

1248
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:26,640
Like you can't get more wealth. So it's

1249
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:29,200
like yeah, that's your message. It's

1250
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,760
like build that wealth or preserve that

1251
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,599
wealth, but be you. Be your authentic

1252
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,559
self and you're going to be fine.

1253
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:38,400
Remember Taurus, okay? Your ninth house

1254
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:41,119
wisdom, inner wisdom, how you see

1255
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:43,599
things. Okay, this is really wonderful.

1256
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:46,079
Okay. And by the way, I forgot to say

1257
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:48,880
this in your main spread. You got the

1258
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:52,720
only two people in all of tarot that

1259
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:56,240
hold that golden scepter of abundance.

1260
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:58,319
Anything they touch turns to gold.

1261
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,480
You're good. You're really, really good.

1262
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:02,960
All right. It's almost like the things

1263
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,720
that you like really want, as long as

1264
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,319
you put that energy there, oh yeah,

1265
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,000

rewarded. All right. Now let's take a

1268
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:15,280
look at uh career. All right. And I'm

1269
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,520
going to say career purpose or passion

1270
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,040
as well. Okay. And passion because you

1271
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,200
know if you're not working it would be

1272
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:23,599
you know. Yeah. So anyway all in the

1273
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:27,359
realm of career purpose or passion for

1274
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:31,280
Virgo sun, moon and rising.

1275
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:34,480
Okay let's see. Ah

00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:40,000
career. Yeah, it does look like there is

1278
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,680
something new with other people

1279
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,240
involved.

1280
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,160
Okay, maybe you're starting a new job,

1281
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,400

1283
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,599
natural here. You know, you rule the

1284
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:56,720
workforce, colleagues, employees. That's

1285
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:59,359

00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,640
this week feels like this big a big

1287
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:02,880
change that's happening, but that's

1288
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,160
really great. There's something new that

1289
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,400
you can look forward to. take that

1290
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,760

want it anyway. All right. And there's

1295
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,760
structure with that with the three of

1296
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:20,800
pentacles. Okay. Really wonderful for

1297
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,160
the long term. Um but just remember it's

1298
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,480
all about teamwork. So there's something

1299
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:27,119
here with other people involved now. Um

1300
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:30,559
but it is a three. What did I say? Birth

1301
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:33,040
of new things but also wanting to learn,

1302
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:35,440
grow, advance, develop, all of that.

1303
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:38,960
Now, uh, health. Let's take a look at

1304
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:41,280
health for Virgo sun, moon, and rising.

1305
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,280
That's it. Okay.

1306
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,119
Uh, health.

1307
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:48,319
It's so funny because this card came up

1308
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:50,800
to my uh or in my mind um when I was

1309
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:51,920
shuffling um the but for your main

1310
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,720
spread, I was like, I think they're

1311
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,480
going to get and you got it. The eight

1312
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,480
of wands. I was just like, there's

1313
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,160
something here when you've got Mars on

1314
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,920
the south node in your sign. There's

1315
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,160
just something here. Remember, Mars is a

1316
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,000
lot of energy. So that's amazing. You

1317
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,440
know, the eight of wands. So, um, very

1318
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,559
excited for you, very happy for you when

1319
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,720
it comes to health. There's something

1320
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:12,559
here that, you know, again, there may be

1321
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,480
something here that there's movement

1322
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,480
around or it could be you like being

1323
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,760
very physically active, which is good

1324
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,200
for your health. And remember,

1325
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,640
everything's connected. When you're good

1326
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,319
to your physical health, that's good for

1327
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,400
your emotional health, for your mental

1328
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:25,839
health, everything's connected, okay?

1329
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,920
When it comes to health. All right? So,

1330
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:30,480
one thing improves the other. This is

1331
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,599
one. So, a lot just very free, very

1332
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,079
invigorating. There's so much

1333
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:36,000
enthusiasm, excitement. So, a lot of it

1334
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:38,319
has to come with like the changes that

1335
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,480
you're going through. All right. So,

1336
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:42,640
really put energy into, you know, things

1337
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,400
that are just just movement. It could

1338
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:47,280
even be in the mind. Sure. Yeah. With

1339
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,440
all this Mercury energy. Um, but, you

1340
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,800
know, it it it it's whatever you want to

1341
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,720
bring into your life because this is

1342
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,160
everything aligning for you, right? But

1343
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,720
you've remember you got to take that

1344
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:59,520
action. I think this is the only wands.

1345
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:03,680
Let me double check. The only wands that

1346
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:05,760
you got. Okay. So feel it. Feel it. This

1347
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:08,000
is great. Okay. We even call it, you

1348
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,760
know, arrows of love. Okay. Wands of

1349
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,280
love. So again, wherever you want to

1350
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,440
direct that energy, whether it is

1351
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,880
career, ones are also career. Yeah. At

1352
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,720
the end of the day, it's your passions.

1353
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,319
Where do you want to put that energy?

1354
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,960
Things can happen fast when you put your

1355
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:23,520
energy there. And then that improves

1356
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,200
health. Now, last card. What is the

1357
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:28,000
biggest message for Virgo sun, moon, and

1358
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:31,000
rising? The pay special attention to

1359
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
card.

1360
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,000
All right. Your biggest message for this

1361
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:42,079
week would be

1362
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:44,240
good. You got the six of pentacles.

1363
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:46,000
You got a lot of pentacles. So, money,

1364
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:48,880
wealth. Like I said, you're really going

1365
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,720
to feel that eighth house activity in a

1366
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,880
big way.

1367
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:55,040
I'm just saying. Juno, you're going to

1368
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,640
feel really strongly this week. She is

1369
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:59,359

1370
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:01,119
money, too. income, salary, you're

1371
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:03,200
signing things or thinking of signing

1372
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,280
things or wanting something here that

1373
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,200
but the six of pentacles, everything's

1374
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,040
harmonizing for you. So, don't worry,

1375
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,559
okay? You're going to be fine.

1376
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,079
Everything's going to be great. You've

1377
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,079
got to, you know, let something go.

1378
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:15,359
Everything, especially in a financial

1379
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,960
sense, but it's also like spiritual

1380
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:19,040
wealth. It's that, you know, taking

1381
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:21,280
those inspired actions is what brings

1382
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:24,000
that spiritual wealth, right? Remember

1383
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:26,480
that inspired actions like actions

1384
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,640
literally in Sanskrit

1385
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,000
translates to karma. So everything is

1386
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,839
you being on this karmic journey. But

1387
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,359
what I really love about this is the six

1388
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:36,000
of pentacles even even in the

1389
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:37,760
writerweight smith deck. Remember it's a

1390
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,760
very philanthropic man with a scale in

1391
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,559
his hand. What did I say about this 19

1392
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:46,000
degree yeah conjunction that's happening

1393
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:48,079
in your sign associated with Libra. So

1394
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,640
balance, peace, harmony, all of that

1395
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:53,839
based on your, you know, intentions,

1396
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:57,119
inspired actions that you take. It's all

1397
00:56:53,839 --> 00:57:00,480
about connecting with others. Okay? All

1398
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:02,880
about that because what comes after the

1399
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,040
five of pentacles would be the six of

1400
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,880
pentacles.

1401
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:09,440
So don't be hard on yourself. There's

1402
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:12,000
going to be you need support. It's right

1403
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:14,559
there. It's coming. A lot of y'all, it's

1404
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,240
going to be you. It's going to be you.

1405
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:18,000
All right? and your sense of service to

1406
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,400
others, supporting others, and that's

1407
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,559
how your karma grows. Okay, so keep that

1408
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:25,599
in mind because in the six of pentacles,

1409
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:27,680
it is the young heropant.

1410
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,839
You got the heropant. You're good,

1411
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:31,680
Virgo. Y'all are amazing. Thank you so

1412
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:33,520
much. I'm very excited for you and I'll

1413
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,359
see you uh next week. All right. Thank

1414
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,520
you. Bye-bye.

1415
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:39,839
Hello, Libra. Thank you so much for

1416
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,640
being members. Um you know what's really

1417
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:43,680
funny? So the special different spread I

1418
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,720
was going to do for you. It's not even a

1419
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,599
spread. I'm going to pull some cards for

1420
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:49,760
you. But because this week, and this is

1421
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:51,760
just bonkers, the reason I'm doing this

1422
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,079
is because this week does feel like a

1423
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:57,680
big ending and a beginning, okay? There

1424
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:59,839
just feels something big here and a big

1425
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:02,720
transition too for a lot of y'all. And

1426
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:04,240
so for a pretty much every sign. And so

1427
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,079
what I'm going to do is like what I do

1428
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,240
with a monthly forecast where I pull a

1429
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:10,160
card well for some themes here. All

1430
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:13,119
right? Because it really does feel this

1431
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:16,079
like this reset. But then look at your

1432
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:17,920
spread. You truly are going through one.

1433
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:20,000
Yeah. You're truly going through a big

1434
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,079
reset. A lot of big changes happening in

1435
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,720
your life and you know it. Big changes

1436
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:27,200
with with the death card, the tower, the

1437
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,480
lovers. I can't even like look across

1438
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,680
your cross. You got the Queen of Wands.

1439
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,760
You got the Knight of Swords. You got

1440
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,960
like

1441
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,280
All right. Let's look at love and

1442
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,880
relationships first because um that's

1443
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:40,359
going to be on on your mind a lot of

1444
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,359
y'all. Okay.

1445
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:46,799
All right, Libra sun, moon, and rising.

1446
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:49,119
What? Oh my gosh, I can't even. You got

1447
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:50,720
temperance.

1448
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:52,480
Amazing.

1449
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,920
So, be very open to communicate.

1450
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,480
Remember, you may have a tendency to

1451
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,920
withdraw. Yeah, with that 12th house

1452
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,640
activity, you also have that T of

1453
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:03,119
swords. It's fine. You can do that. Have

1454
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,720
meditative moments, but temperance is

1455
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,960
all about like finding that inner

1456
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,720
balance, moderation. You get this.

1457
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,440
You're Libra, right? But the biggest

1458
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:13,359
thing of all is practicing patience.

1459
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,559
That's all. And I told you that there's

1460
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:16,160
going to be a lot of y'all that are

1461
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,599
going to be like, "Now I got to do this.

1462
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,520
This has got to happen. This I need the

1463
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:21,359
answer for this now." And like, "No, no,

1464
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,280
no, no. You're going to be fine.

1465
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:25,200
Everything's working out exactly the way

1466
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,520
it's supposed to." All right. Remember,

1467
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,880
we talked about divine timing. Now,

1468
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,720
second, and this is love and

1469
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,200
relationship. So, you're going to have a

1470
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,720
lot of insights to when you like and

1471
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,240
just enjoy the moment. That's all you

1472
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:39,680
got to do. All right? Be present in the

1473
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:40,799
moment. Now, second thing, uh, career.

1474
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:46,520
And if you're not here for career, let's

1475
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:46,520
call it career, purpose, or passion.

1476
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:54,559
Okay. Okay. What do we have?

1477
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:56,160
Queen of Swords. Queen of Swords is you.

1478
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:58,720
You know that, right? And remember, I

1479
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:01,440
said Juno is very active this week. And

1480
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:04,319
she is again Jupiter's wife. All about

1481
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:08,000
truth, justice. Aris is very active.

1482
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:09,440
She's a little Yeah, Queen of Swords can

1483
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,040
be that way. She's left all her emotions

1484
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,799
at the door. She needs to. She doesn't

1485
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,640
want her emotions to cloud her judgment.

1486
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:16,319
Head above the clouds making big

1487
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,640
decision. It seems like when it comes to

1488
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:19,760
career, your purpose, um passion, there

1489
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,960
is some sort of fairness that you're

1490
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,720
seeking. There is something where you

1491
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,240
are being your authentic self. Okay? You

1492
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,319
want to let that side shine, but you

1493
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,760
also want to like not let anyone push

1494
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:29,839
you over, but also you don't want to be

1495
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:33,079
like, you know,

1496
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:33,079
to others.

1497
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:39,559
It would be Mercury in Leo retrograde

1498
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,559
too. It's like

1499
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:46,200
let's look at health.

1500
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,200
Let's look at health.

1501
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,920
All right, Leo.

1502
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,760
Leo, Libra.

1503
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:56,000
So, if you are new, when you get the

1504
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,400
same card from two different decks,

1505
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,599
maybe you really want to pay attention.

1506
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,599
The universe trying to tell you

1507
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:02,599
something.

1508
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:09,520
health. Okay, slow down. That's it. Slow

1509
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:11,359
down. You got one card saying practice

1510
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:14,480
patience. You got the queen of swords

1511
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:16,559
who's very patient.

1512
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,640
Two knight of swords. Slow down. That's

1513
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:23,040
it. You can go after the things you

1514
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:24,960
want, but don't get um you know,

1515
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:27,119
people are may not be keeping up with

1516
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,960
your pace.

1517
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:32,960
Just remember, it's a weekly that's it.

1518
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:34,960
It's is a weekly forecast. All right.

1519
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,319
But the other thing is like don't also

1520
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,000
um when it comes to health, it's more

1521
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:40,240
about mental health here. Yeah, you've

1522
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,559
got the Mars South node conjunction and

1523
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:44,400
your 12th. All right. Up here, right? I

1524
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:46,240
said all those planets, you know, in

1525
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,480
that Mercury ruled sign that this is

1526
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:51,920
happening in Knight of Swords is

1527
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:54,160
Mercurial. He's Gemini. Yeah, that's in

1528
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,440
your ninth. Your perspective on things.

1529
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,799
So, there's something here where it's

1530
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,440
just the bigger message coming through

1531
01:01:56,799 --> 01:02:01,599
for me. So he can be like a little in

1532
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:04,160
like forceful, a little bit impulsive

1533
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:07,359
too. And that is Uranian energy to be

1534
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:10,960
honest. That impulsive like spontaneous.

1535
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:13,839
So which is fine, but just make sure

1536
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:15,520
that you're not like all over the place.

1537
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:18,480
Yeah, use that because it is a lot of

1538
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:20,400
fire and air honest like honestly this

1539
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,920
week. So just stay a little bit grounded

1540
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,359
and still say the things you need to

1541
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,760
say, do the things you need to do.

1542
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:28,799
That's fine. Just know that there may be

1543
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:31,040
a little bit of like

1544
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:33,680
we got to go a little bit slower just

1545
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:35,359
for this week. Okay. Now, last thing is

1546
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:37,599
uh the biggest message for Libra. What

1547
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:40,400
does Libra need to know this month? I'm

1548
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:44,680
sorry, this week. Yeah, this week. What

1549
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,680
do they have to really pay attention to?

1550
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:58,640
Some of y'all retiring.

1551
01:02:57,359 --> 01:03:01,200
Looks like it. Some of y'all are

1552
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:02,480
thinking about retiring. Um, well, you

1553
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,240
do have the nine of pentacles. You have

1554
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,000
the nine of coins. Okay. So there is

1555
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:09,520
something here where it's like your

1556
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,440
biggest message is uh really working on

1557
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:14,480
yourself. It does seem like there is

1558
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:17,359
going to be something in terms of you

1559
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:19,839
having your moment in terms of this is

1560
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:22,240
the direction I'm going right all this

1561
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:24,240
wealth not having to worry about money

1562
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:27,680
not having to worry about anything being

1563
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:30,079
in this you know garden of abundance

1564
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:34,400
having worked my way hard. I've earned

1565
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:36,240
my spot here. So that's really nice and

1566
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,799
a lot of you are just going to get it.

1567
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:40,559
You do you do you you do what you know

1568
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:42,480
you're going to get it with that nine of

1569
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:45,359
nine of pentacles which by the way is a

1570
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,960
Virgo card and so what really comes

1571
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:49,039
through strongly for me is like mind

1572
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:51,039
over matter. Patience is a big thing by

1573
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:53,599
the way but also like mind over matter

1574
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:56,880
and that has to do with what's happening

1575
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:59,680
for you anyway. Just any blockages up

1576
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:01,680
here is

1577
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:05,119
anything that you're doing, any habits,

1578
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:07,200
any like like anything. Okay, it's it's

1579
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:10,160
time to change things up. You're about

1580
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:13,039
to move into

1581
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:15,039
a lot of stuff next week. All right,

1582
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:17,039
your life is changing. Libra, y'all are

1583
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:19,920
amazing. And that's amazing. The nine of

1584
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:22,559
pentacles, that's very auspicious. Okay.

1585
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:25,039
A lot of like uh you know wisdom,

1586
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:27,839
enlightenment and and again that

1587
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:30,400
independence. It feels really good.

1588
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:32,720
There's something here that you're going

1589
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,480
to feel this wealth that feels really

1590
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:36,000
good. Especially again with that three

1591
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,520
of cups and that queen of wands, but

1592
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,760
there is a little bit of like there's

1593
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:42,000
something that's got to to get there.

1594
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:44,079
Okay,

1595
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,400
you're good. Libra, I'll see you next

1596
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:48,240
week. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

1597
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:51,440
Hello, Scorpio. Thank you so much for

1598
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:55,520
being members. Big week. All right. This

1599
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:57,359
is, you know, again, I just to to be

1600
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,760
honest, like there are some other signs

1601
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:02,240
that have this Mars South node

1602
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,799
conjunction. They'll feel it a little

1603
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:07,200
bit. They're going to really feel it,

1604
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:08,799
but for you, it just it just feels like

1605
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,480
adjustments.

1606
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:12,480
Uh but there is a little bit of

1607
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,400
intensity with Uranus and Venus and your

1608
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:16,079
eighth. But just keep that's with

1609
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,839
relationships and you know, building

1610
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:19,760
wealth. But you can clearly see you're

1611
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:22,480
going to be fine. Just don't miss out on

1612
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:25,280
that. Really going within to think about

1613
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,680
your future. All right. Now, because

1614
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:30,880
this week is one of those sneaky weeks

1615
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:33,680
that is actually one of the most

1616
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:35,839
important weeks, it's it's big.

1617
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:39,200
Everything's connected. the eclipse that

1618
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:40,960
we had the south node with Mars in Virgo

1619
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:43,920
the eclipse that we're going to have in

1620
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:46,960
Virgo in September everything it so it

1621
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:50,640
does feel like this is like a death and

1622
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:52,480
rebirth moment this week for every sign

1623
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,680
so the spread it's not even a spread

1624
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,599
that I'm going to do for you it's going

1625
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,720
to be like the monthly forecast where

1626
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:58,160
I'm going to pull some cards and we're

1627
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:00,000
going to focus on different areas of

1628
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,880
your life because it really does feel

1629
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,640
like

1630
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:05,200
there's some new chapter this week okay

1631
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:07,440
so why don't we start with Um, love and

1632
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:09,200
relationships. What can we expect for

1633
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,960
Scorpio?

1634
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:14,799
That card didn't well two cards didn't

1635
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:16,400
want to go. All right. So, you have

1636
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:18,079
you know what's really funny? I was

1637
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,839
writing I was scripting everything out

1638
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:22,319
for you know all the aspects that were

1639
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:23,599
happening.

1640
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:26,720
What's happening with a lot of the

1641
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:31,359
asteroids of planettoids. It does feel

1642
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:32,960
like there is a lot of queen energy and

1643
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:35,680
you just got two queens. You got the

1644
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,960
queen of wands and the which one? Queen

1645
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,640
of pentacles, right? Yeah. Queen of

1646
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:42,160
coins.

1647
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:43,440
So amazing because one thing that I

1648
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:48,480
didn't and that's the other thing if

1649
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:51,839
you're new to this Whoa. I just

1650
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:55,440
we we talk about some things here. Okay.

1651
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:59,680
That maybe I didn't have time to. You

1652
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:01,920
didn't get any wands. You got no wands.

1653
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:03,599
Where's that passion? Where's that

1654
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,200
passion? Ones are so invigorating. And

1655
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:06,559
I'm not saying that it's like a bad

1656
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,480
thing, good thing or anything like that.

1657
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:09,680
It's just like, you know, there's no

1658
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:12,640
want. So, you want to just consider

1659
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:15,680
that. And uh there could just, you know,

1660
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:18,799
you've got Mars and Virgo. It's a little

1661
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:20,319
different, but it it blends well with

1662
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:22,799
you being a water sign, Virgo being

1663
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:24,559
earth. Use it. But anyway, Queen of

1664
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:26,880
Wands. Remember I said you're going to

1665
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,960
be a magnet this week. She's a magnet.

1666
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,799
She gets whatever she wants. She is the

1667
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:34,720
entrepreneur. You have a lot of work

1668
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:36,960
stuff here. Okay. But this is for love

1669
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:41,200
and relationships. The Queen of Wands is

1670
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:44,720
the most sexual. Yeah, I told you she's

1671
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:46,400
a magnet. So, she remember you got Venus

1672
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,319
and so Venus in Gemini. That's very

1673
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,640
social. That's magnetism. Even the

1674
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:51,839
Mercury sexile Venus. So, yeah, you're

1675
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,119
going to feel that. It's going to be

1676
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:56,079
really nice. And you have the queen of

1677
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:57,839
pentacles who also has a lot of like

1678
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:02,319
elements

1679
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:04,000
that like magician energy. Okay. Um so

1680
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:07,039
there does seem like there is something

1681
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,680
here like a new feeling for you but

1682
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:12,240
there's still that I want to take care

1683
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:13,680
of this relationship. I want to be the

1684
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,880
person. I want to be the protector. I

1685
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,080
want to be the provider but I also want

1686
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,359
to have a lot of fun and I want to be

1687
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,799
the one that Do you know what I mean?

1688
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:20,319
Like that kind of energy but you're

1689
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:22,880
going to feel that fear like queen. It's

1690
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:24,400
a lead. They're leaders. Yeah, I said

1691
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,520
you're going to feel a lot of power. So,

1692
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,679
this is really great. Queen of

1693
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,600
Pentacles, it's your physical reality.

1694
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:31,279
So, you know, it's like this world that

1695
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,359
you envision for yourself that you want

1696
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:36,719
to build for yourself where someone else

1697
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:37,839
is within your vision of your future of

1698
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:40,560
the world that you want to build.

1699
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:42,719
Anyway, I love this. So, things look

1700
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,319
good is all I'm saying. Now, let's see

1701
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:47,759
career. And if you're not here for

1702
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:50,239
career, let's call it career, purpose,

1703
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:51,839
or passion.

1704
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:54,719

it comes to career. And remember, you're

01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:04,159

1710
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:06,319
you when you got Uranus and Venus and

1711
01:09:04,159 --> 01:09:10,719

Virgo which rules health. Okay.

1741
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:28,880

1742
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:30,480
and the eight of swords down here.

1743
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:33,440
You got to be honest with yourself about

1744
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:36,719
something. Okay. That's all there is.

1745
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:39,920
Okay. And then to be honest when you've

1746
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:42,960

01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:55,040
that you are

1750
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:57,920
holding holding in

1751
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:00,719
that's not good for your health mentally

1752
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:02,480
and it's all connected. mental health

here. You got it's like you got to see

1757
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:14,000

1760
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:21,040
just keep that in mind. That's the seven

1761
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,159
of swords. The other thing is if there

1762
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,640
are things that are happening within

1763
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:27,199
your world, right? Someone that may be

1764
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:29,199
cheating on you, lying to you because

1765
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:33,120
this is the card of lying, cheating,

1766
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:34,960
stealing, deception as well. So it might

1767
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:37,199
not even be you. There may be something

1768
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:40,400
that's happening where you're just kind

1769
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:44,080
of turning a blind eye. All right. But

1770
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:45,600
you have all this potential to own this

1771
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:49,960
situation.

1772
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,960
So, okay.

1773
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:59,719
You got to have self-belief.

1774
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:59,719
I'll do a clarify for that one.

1775
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:05,040
Yeah, you're going to be fine as long as

1776
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:07,600
you are honest with yourself with

1777
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:10,320
something inside you. You got to say you

1778
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,920
got to say it. Remember Mercury sexile

1779
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:14,719
Venus. That's a perfect opportunity. Say

1780
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:16,159
what's on your mind. Nine of Pentacles.

1781
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:18,000
You and all your pentacles. I don't even

1782
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:21,120
know where to put like you. Okay. So,

1783
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:24,560
there you go. Amazing. So, you see when

1784
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:26,640
you free yourself. Yeah. Free your mind.

1785
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,719
It's a swords. Swords are the mental

1786
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,239
suit for when you free your mind, right?

1787
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:33,199
You got that nine of pentacles

1788
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:35,679
clarifying it. This is not having to

1789
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:38,239
worry or stress and this is earning your

1790
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:39,840
spot in this garden of abundance and

1791
01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:42,000
everything happening for you and

1792
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,920
freedom. Nine of pentacles is freedom.

1793
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,320
Freeing yourself. All right. So, there's

1794
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:48,640
something here. Free yourself from it.

1795
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:51,280
Okay. Now, last card, the biggest

1796
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:53,199
message. What is the uh pay special

1797
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:55,840
attention to card for Scorpio? What

1798
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:59,159
should they pay special attention to

1799
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:59,159
this week?

1800
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:06,960
Yeah. Uh, you got a decision to make.

1801
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,000
You got the two of swords. It might have

1802
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,520
to do with partnerships and

1803
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,800
relationships, legal matters,

1804
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:13,040
everything. You know, this card is

1805
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:15,679
attributed to moon in Libra. I did say

1806
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:18,320
that we do have, you know, the uh Libra

1807
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:21,600
degree activations this week. Yeah. but

1808
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:26,320
also Juno associated with Libra that's

1809
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:28,640
in your sign. So,

1810
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:30,719
there's something here. Okay, there's

1811
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:33,520
something here. And remember in the

1812
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:35,920
writerweight Smith deck, she's

1813
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:37,679
blindfolded, too. So, you've got to

1814
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:41,360
trust your intuition. You've got to

1815
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:43,040
trust your emotions. Again, there just

1816
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:46,239
may be something here you've really got

1817
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:48,560
to look at. or maybe something you saw

1818
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:52,480
but if you turn a blind eye to it that

1819
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:54,400
doesn't solve anything right so

1820
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:56,239
it's being your authentic self that you

1821
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,320
want to be I'll clarify the two of

1822
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:59,920
swords and again if you're not here for

1823
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,920
it can be care it can be care it can be

1824
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:04,080
career and work you got so much career

1825
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:06,000
work stuff happening and remember also

1826
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:09,120
friendships and you know groups you

1827
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,280
belong to societies

1828
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:13,360
your secret society I mean you are a

1829
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:16,400
Scorpio that was a that's actually a

1830
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:19,400
funny joke.

1831
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,400
Yeah.

1832
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:28,239
If you listen if all all you got to do

1833
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:30,800
is is be honest with yourself. Don't you

1834
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:33,920
know that's all you got to do. You got

1835
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:36,239
the sun clarifying it. The sun is the

1836
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:37,760
biggest yes in tarot. Have you ever

1837
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:40,080
gotten a tarot reading? Is the biggest

1838
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:42,800
yes. It's optimism. It's opportunities.

1839
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:44,239
It's happiness. It's joy. Vitality. I

1840
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,280
said something about a rebirth here.

1841
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:47,760
Well, there you go. There's your

1842
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:52,159
affirmation with the sun with uh you

1843
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:53,920
know there's a it is card 19. Yeah. So

1844
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:56,320
there you go. There's going to be a big

1845
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:58,960
Mars south node conjunction at 19

1846
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:00,960
degrees but also it's a Libra degree. So

1847
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,280
peace, harmony, justice, especially with

1848
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:05,840
partnerships, relationships even you got

1849
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:10,960
the moon in Taurus this week but the sun

1850
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:13,120
card 19 1 plus 9 equals 10 1

1851
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:15,040
rebirth. There's something new, but you

1852
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:16,560
got to be able to fade something. It

1853
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:18,159
really is. You even saw remember you got

1854
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,880
that page of cups clarifier, that new,

1855
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:22,560
fresh, new energy. What is What is the

1856
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,400
thing here that's holding you back? And

1857
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:26,480
again, a lot of it can be up here. It's

1858
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:29,280
a week to free your mind. Anyway, you're

1859
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:30,719
actually really good. I love that. And

1860
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:32,880
remember, this is all potential. It's

1861
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:35,120
the actions that you take. Take that

1862
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:38,239
action. Okay, Scorpio. You are amazing.

1863
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:40,080
I will see you uh next week. Bye-bye.

1864
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:42,719
Hello, Sagittarius. Thank you so much

1865
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:46,640
for being members. Let me move that.

1866
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:48,640
Okay. So, this this week because I was

1867
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:50,640
looking and you know we are between the

1868
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:53,199
full moon and the new moon but with the

1869
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:56,719
south node activation it really does

1870
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:59,040
feel like a type of reset. And so what

1871
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:01,440
I'm going to do is uh you know in the

1872
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:03,520
monthly forecast for the bonus spreads

1873
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:05,120
we look at different themes right so I'm

1874
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:07,600
going to do that because it does feel

1875
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:11,120
like there's some start new start a

1876
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:14,239
refresh or something here that feels

1877
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:17,239
big. All right. So, let's start with

1878
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:17,239
love.

1879
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:24,320
Oh, you got a card popping out for you

1880
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:26,239
already. What can um Sagittarius suspect

1881
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:29,920
with love and relationships? Here you

1882
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:33,760
go. Those two. Okay. First one. Oh,

1883
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:36,640
let's look at them all. Uh yeah, that

1884
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:39,040
may be the thing. Okay. When uh Okay.

1885
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:41,440
You got strength.

1886
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:43,440
Have that confidence. Okay. have that

1887
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:44,719
confidence, infinite possibilities. When

1888
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,400
you have that inner courage, that

1889
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:47,840
strength, you can do it. You can get

1890
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:50,080
through this. That's all it's saying.

1891
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:53,520
You've got this. Okay? Have the

1892
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:55,280
conversations you need to have to um

1893
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:58,159
yeah,

1894
01:16:55,280 --> 01:17:00,800
should you feel

1895
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:03,840
that you need that, but on the flip

1896
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:05,840
side, hey, a lot of y'all do feel

1897
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:08,159
empowered when it comes to love. Okay?

1898
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:10,080
Again, that's just looking at what's

1899
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:12,080
happening like Yeah. So, love and

1900
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:13,840
relationships looks really good. Just

1901
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:15,360
remember, be your authentic self. That's

1902
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:17,600
a lot of authenticity there in the

1903
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:20,239
strength card. All right. And then the

1904
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:22,320
other cards. Yeah,

1905
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:24,880
you've got to know what you want. You've

1906
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:27,120
got the three of swords,

1907
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:28,560
seven of cups. So, when it comes to love

1908
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:30,080
and relationships, there can be

1909
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:32,320
something that you have to face this

1910
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,840
week. Okay. Seven of cups is just really

1911
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:35,280
saying like, what do you want? But you

1912
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:39,440
got to know it. You got to feel it deep

1913
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:40,800
down in your bones when it's like you've

1914
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:43,040
you've really got to know which

1915
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,360
direction you want to go at this point.

1916
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:47,760
And even though it's not part of the

1917
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:49,920
south node, it really still is like that

1918
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:52,800
north node activation and Pisces in your

1919
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:54,560
fourth home and family or significant

1920
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,080
other. And then you've got Uranus and

1921
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,280
Venus, a planet of love and

1922
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:59,679
relationships and your seventh of

1923
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:01,040
partnerships and relationships. So there

1924
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:03,199
there's you're going to have a lot of

1925
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:06,400
activity there. There could be something

1926
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:08,320
that you have to really face, okay, in

1927
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:10,400
terms of and it may just be you saying

1928
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:15,040
like, okay, do I want to change anything

1929
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:18,640
up here? Uranus wants to change what

1930
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:20,560
you've got to change something and it it

1931
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:25,199
be it can be the smallest thing to be

1932
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:27,679
honest, but a Venus is here. It feels a

1933
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:29,920
little bigger. Okay, you have the moon

1934
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:31,920
in Gemini, too. Remember that you're

1935
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:34,080
going to be very It's very stimulating.

1936
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,679
It's very social. I feel like that's why

1937
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:38,239
I'm just trying to tell you like have

1938
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:41,199
your moment, but just come back. All

1939
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:44,000
right. Now, uh you I'll do one more.

1940
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:46,159
I'll do I'll

1941
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,719
What dropped?

1942
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:50,400
Yeah, it is. There's some relationship

1943
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:53,920
that is holding you back. There is a

1944
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:56,719
relationship to be like really honest

1945
01:18:53,920 --> 01:19:00,480
with you that's not it's like you're

1946
01:18:56,719 --> 01:19:04,400
that's it that you've got to look at it.

1947
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:06,320
Okay, if you are new to the bonus right

1948
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,840
tier three or you know when you get the

1949
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,760
same card from two different decks you

1950
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:12,560
really got to pay attention to that

1951
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:15,520
message the five of pentacles there's

1952
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:18,400
something where you feel lit like left

1953
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:19,520
out in the cold someone's not

1954
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:21,040
you're not seeing out of eye with

1955
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:23,600
someone in terms of relationship when it

1956
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:25,920
comes to love and relationships or maybe

1957
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:28,000
you're in a place where you know if you

1958
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:30,159
are single things are not aligning the

1959
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:33,360
way that you want right now again And

1960
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:36,239
this is just a weekly reading. Yeah. So

1961
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:37,679
don't be hard on yourself. All right?

1962
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:39,199
Because at the end of the day, even

1963
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:42,320
though you have Mars in the south node

1964
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:43,920
in Virgo and your 10th to be honest,

1965
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:48,719
remember

1966
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:51,679
Virgo is Mercury ruled shared by Gemini,

1967
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:54,960
which is Mercury ruled. That's

1968
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:58,719
your seventh house where you have Venus

1969
01:19:54,960 --> 01:20:00,400
and Uranus, shakeups and breakups

1970
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:03,280
with love.

1971
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:05,199
So, it's up to you. It's up to you.

1972
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:08,080
Okay. Just know you got some great

1973
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:10,159
things to look forward to. Now, uh I

1974
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:11,840
didn't actually those card all of those.

1975
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:14,640
I'll do one more. I'll actually pull a

1976
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:18,080
card because all those just kind of fell

1977
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:21,080
out. Jumped out. Jumpers.

1978
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:21,080
All right.

1979
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:31,199
You've got the Ace of Wands.

1980
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:33,440
to you see all that potential there if

1981
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:34,960
you can. This is in knowing what you

1982
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,400
want. There could be the ending of a

1983
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:38,400
relationship. Maybe someone broke up

1984
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:41,280
with you. Maybe you're going through a

1985
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:44,159
process that you know doesn't feel fun

1986
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:45,440
uh in a relationship. Just know that you

1987
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:48,159
got something to look forward to. On the

1988
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:49,679
other side, we got the Ace of Wands.

1989
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:51,360
Something really needs. The universe

1990
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:53,440
offering you this gift that's going to

1991
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:54,880
make you really happy, wish come true.

1992
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:56,719
You're going through change anyway. You

1993
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:58,640
got all the support that's you know what

1994
01:20:56,719 --> 01:21:01,840
I mean? like you're good. The Ace of

1995
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:04,960
Wands. Yeah. Okay. Wands are very

1996
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:09,199
invigorating, very enthusiastic. They're

1997
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:11,760
a fire. They're you. They're fire. So,

1998
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:13,280
feel fired up. There's something new.

1999
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:16,880
And it could be a current relationship.

2000
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:18,640
Again, it it's what applies to you. All

2001
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,920
right? But if you're single, there could

2002
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,920
be something there. If you're in a

2003
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:26,080
relationship, there could be a little

2004
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:28,320
bump in the road. But once you patch

2005
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:29,520
things up, have those conversations,

2006
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,760
we're going to be fine. Now, let's get

2007
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,920
to career. And if you're not here for

2008
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:35,440
career, let's do career, purpose, or

2009
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:38,760
passion. Let's call it career, purpose,

2010
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:38,760
or passion.

2011
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:44,960
Okay, I'm going to All right. So, uh,

2012
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:47,280
yeah, you're going to be fine with

2013
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:49,360
career.

2014
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:51,360
You're going to be fine with career. I I

2015
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:54,480
really wanted to say like five different

2016
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:57,360
swear words. Like, this is insane. Um,

2017
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:59,199
so again, same cards that pop up. Pay

2018
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:03,080
attention. Career looks really good. You

2019
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:03,080
got the magician twice

2020
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:08,480
again. Something's ending for something

2021
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:10,400
in beginning. Yeah. And you got the nine

2022
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:13,040
of cups

2023
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:14,560
twice. Actually, didn't you get it in

2024
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:16,800
your bonus reading last week, too? You

2025
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:18,400
got the nine of cups twice because you

2026
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:21,199
did get the nine of cups in your spread

2027
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:22,880
last week. So again, do you see how

2028
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:27,360
everything is leading up to something

2029
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:29,040
that you want and you're going to get?

2030
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:31,760
You're good. You're absolutely good.

2031
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:33,040
Now, let's take a look at um you're

2032
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:38,040
having some of the biggest career

2033
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:38,040
changes. Let's look at uh health.

2034
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:46,080
All right. So, um uh great Queen of

2035
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:49,760
Wands.

2036
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:52,560
Uh yeah, she's charming. She's magnetic.

2037
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:55,600
She's social. She's fun. Like people

2038
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:59,920
love her. She loves attention. This is

2039
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:01,840
you. All right. So, be social. Have fun.

2040
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:03,440
Okay. Don't be hard on yourself. Go out

2041
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:07,040
there.

2042
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:08,400
This is great. Okay. For health that

2043
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,679
when you're laughing, when you're

2044
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:12,480
joyful, when you're, you know what I

2045
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:13,760
mean? Like that

2046
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:15,920
everything's connected with health,

2047
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:19,760
mental health, social health, emotional

2048
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:21,199
health, everything changes. Okay,

2049
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:23,199
that's why we're here. We're we're all

2050
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:24,800
connected with each other. Connect. This

2051
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:26,239
is a great week to you. This is the last

2052
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,080
week I think when you got Venus in

2053
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:30,800
Gemini.

2054
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:32,960
All right, last card. The biggest

2055
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:34,960
message for you Sagittarius, the pay

2056
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:38,239
special attention to card. What should

2057
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:41,280
Sagittarius pay special attention to

2058
01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:43,840
this week? Uh that would be the fact

2059
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:46,960
that you are going to have a huge

2060
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:50,000
breakthrough. And if there is anything I

2061
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:51,840
should tell you is to have it. Have the

2062
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,280
biggest breakthrough of your life. You

2063
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:56,080
have the ace of swords. You got your

2064
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:57,280
second ace. Yeah. This is having a huge

2065
01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:00,080
breakthrough. And this is like being

2066
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:02,960
honest with yourself. True perception.

2067
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:06,000
This is the biggest sword in the deck.

2068
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:07,920
You got a lot of power. All right. Uh it

2069
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,440
does seem like uh there may be a

2070
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:12,639
contract like I said signing. There's

2071
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:14,480
something signing. Yeah. Also big

2072
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:17,920
brilliant idea coming out of nowhere.

2073
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:20,719
But you see these paths, these new paths

2074
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:22,719
opening up for you, right? You see that?

2075
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:24,000
So, whatever if this week where it's

2076
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:26,719
just like there's just something like

2077
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,440
where you feel a little, it feels a

2078
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:32,880
little quick sandy or even just feeling

2079
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:36,159
like a stop sign like stuck like

2080
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:40,280
literally being the sign on a sidewalk

2081
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:40,280
or whatever. Um,

2082
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:45,040
it's not what you want. It's not what

2083
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:47,760
you want. there's other things you want.

2084
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:49,440
You just got to move in that direction

2085
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:51,520
and just, you know, knights are very

2086
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:53,120
active, right? So, taking that action,

2087
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,239
it seems like you are moving toward the

2088
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:56,800
things that are going to bring you a lot

2089
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:58,159
of joy and emotional wealth and and all

2090
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,360
of that. Everything that I talked about,

2091
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:00,639
you got the Knight of Cups in your final

2092
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:02,320
outcome, but there is going to be a

2093
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:03,679
little bit of a you're going to have to

2094
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:05,840
make some decisions. You're going to

2095
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:07,679
have to actually look at like look under

2096
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:10,560
the cover for some things, especially

2097
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:13,760
with relationships, career,

2098
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:15,679
family, home. All right, you're actually

2099
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:18,000
really good. Sagittarius, thank you so

2100
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:20,480

2102
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:26,159
Capricorn. Thank you so much for being

01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:28,560
members. Um we are going to do something

2104
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:30,400
different. All right. Now, what I'm

2105
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:34,639
doing is because this week and

2106
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:36,960
especially for you, um, it just feels

2107
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:39,760
like,

2108
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:41,840
you know, between your full moon and and

2109
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:43,280
the new moon next week, there's just

2110
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:46,560
something here this week, especially

2111
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:48,960
with this Mars South node activation, it

2112
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:50,320
does feel like there's an ending and a

2113
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:53,120
beginning. It does feel like there's

2114
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:55,920
this death and rebirth. It does feel

2115
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:57,280
very significant. So, I'm just going to

2116
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,040
do I'm going to pull cards like I do in

2117
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:00,719
the monthly forecast. All right, just

2118
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:02,400
because there feels like some and you

2119
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:04,800
can see there is something brand new for

2120
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:08,000
you anyway. So, let's do it. Let's take

2121
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:10,480
a look at love first. I want to see love

2122
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:15,560
with you and your two of cups, the

2123
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:15,560
magician, and anyway, let's see.

2124
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,840
Let's see what Capricorn can expect in

2125
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:24,840
love and relationships.

2126
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,840
M.

2127
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:31,040
Oh gosh.

2128
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:34,000
So, uh,

2129
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:36,960
you got the five of swords

2130
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,400
and you got the fool.

2131
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:41,440
There's something new happening for

2132
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:44,159
sure, but you got to you got to there's

2133
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:45,840
you got to like let's Can we drop the

2134
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:47,600
swords?

2135
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:49,440
That's all there's to it. Can we drop

2136
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:52,000
the swords?

2137
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:54,960
Okay. And because there's going to be a

2138
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:57,600
lot happening in in your mind, it could

2139
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:59,920
be a lot of tugof-war up here. Remember,

2140
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,679
you don't want that energy of, you know,

2141
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:03,360
if you don't drop those forwards swords,

2142
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:05,920
you can eventually get to the eight of

2143
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:08,480
swords. So, uh, drop those swords and

2144
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:11,679
look what happens. You got the fool and

2145
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:14,320
this is taking risks. This is like ready

2146
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:15,440
to This is the you're brand new fool.

2147
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:17,760
You got the fool and the magician.

2148
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:19,360
You're good. Uh, a lot of potential

2149
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,400
there. Things look really good,

2150
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,920
especially if you're single. Like I

2151
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:23,520
said, if you're single, really great.

2152
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:25,120
Um,

2153
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:27,199
and and that's the case for the entire

2154
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:29,280
year, by the way, until June 2026 with

2155
01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:30,800
Jupiter and Cancer, by the way, uh, for

2156
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:34,080
you Capricorn. But yeah, there just

2157
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:35,520
seems even a revival in in some area in

2158
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:38,000
your life. And again, a lot of it has to

2159
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:40,480
do with your mind this week. Now, let's

2160
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,120
and spirituality now uh, let's higher

2161
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:46,480
mind. Let's see uh, and physical. Let's

2162
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:47,760
see. Sorry, I keep let's see career.

2163
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,800
Let's see career, which is going to be a

2164
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,960
big thing. And if you're not here for a

2165
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:54,960
career, if you're not working, let's

2166
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:57,840
call it career, purpose, or passion or

2167
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:59,840
all three.

2168
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:01,760
All right, Capricorn.

2169
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,880
Oh, yeah. You, you and your pentacles,

2170
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,320
you got the Queen of Pentacles. You're

2171
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:06,719
going to be fine with career. You're

2172
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:08,159
going to be fine with career. Um, it

2173
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:10,159
feels like a lot of things that are

2174
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:12,320
really motivating you and just kind of

2175
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:13,520
like uh where you're feeling that drive.

2176
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:15,679
Remember, you're going to feel a lot of

2177
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:18,000
like that mama bear energy this week,

2178
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:19,360
taking care of others, nurturing others,

2179
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,040
uh even nurturing yourself, taking care

2180
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:22,400
of yourself. So, you can nurture and

2181
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:24,719
support others. But that Queen of

2182
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:26,960
Pentacles, not only is she the richest

2183
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:30,080
queen, but she takes care of others. She

2184
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:33,120
has resources to do so. So, she's a very

2185
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:36,159
loving, you know, uh queen, like really

2186
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:38,960
uh even like protective energy and yeah,

2187
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:42,159
she considers others for for why she

2188
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:45,679
does what she does. Okay. So, love it. I

2189
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:46,960
love that. Uh, and again, rich as queen

2190
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:51,719
health. Let's see what's going on for

2191
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:51,719
you, Capricorn, with health.

2192
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:57,360
All right,

2193
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:59,520
you got the emperor. Uh, here's the

2194
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:01,280
thing. The big message coming through is

2195
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:03,840
just really take charge, okay? Really

2196
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:05,120
take charge. Uh, and you'll have no

2197
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:07,199
problem as long as you have that

2198
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:09,600
confidence. And like I said, you've got

2199
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:12,719
Mars conjunct the south node in Virgo

2200
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:14,880
that rules health, right? And your

2201
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:16,639
ninth, which is all about your mindset,

2202
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:18,560
how you're seeing things, self-belief.

2203
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:19,600
Okay? So, have that confidence. Pull

2204
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,120
that through. But it just seems like

2205
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,639
you're going to be fine anyway. All

2206
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,320
right. When it comes to health, physical

2207
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:25,600
health, mental health, emotional health,

2208
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:28,159
as long as you have that confidence and

2209
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:32,480
you're just I is the emperor, that's

2210
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:35,120
literally like a mastery of self. So

2211
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:37,120
yeah, it's it's it's you've got to

2212
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:39,440
believe in you. And in some cases, you

2213
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:41,120
do have to put yourself first in order

2214
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:43,120
for you. He's another person that takes

2215
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:44,880
care of others, okay? He's someone that

2216
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:46,960
would take a bullet for other people.

2217
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,560
Like he's the ruler of the land. He's

2218
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:51,360
going to protect his land and his

2219
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:53,120
people. So in terms of health, it looks

2220
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:56,960
really, really, really good. But just

2221
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:58,320
don't like be over, you know, it just

2222
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:00,239
feels like there's so much happening for

2223
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:03,360
you. Try not to overexhaust yourself.

2224
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:05,040
Okay. now uh by taking on a lot of

2225
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:08,159
responsibilities and duties. If there's

2226
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:11,880
anything like just you don't want to you

2227
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:11,880
just avoid any burnout

2228
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:16,800
now.

2229
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:19,520
Okay. So, what is your biggest message?

2230
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:21,440
Sorry, I'm like looking at some other

2231
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:24,719
What's your biggest What is the message

2232
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:26,480
for Capricorn this week? The pay special

2233
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:32,639
attention to card. What should Capricorn

2234
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:36,719
pay special attention to this week?

2235
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:38,239
Yes. So, oh, I'm so glad this happened.

2236
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:40,560
Uh, if you're new, when the same card

2237
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:42,880
comes out from two different decks, it's

2238
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,560
over 170 cards. You know the universe is

2239
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:47,560
really trying to tell you something.

2240
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:47,560
Okay?

2241
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:52,800
You can't do that no more.

2242
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:55,199
That's your biggest message. Don't be

2243
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,960
hard on yourself. Don't be hard on

2244
01:30:55,199 --> 01:31:00,639
yourself.

2245
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:04,560
This is the point where you know there's

2246
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:08,239
something a habit, a pattern, the way

2247
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:12,239
you're thinking, pessimistic thinking.

2248
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:14,000
It's got to go. It's got to go. Okay.

2249
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:17,679
Because just like that eight of swords,

2250
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,600
this is also they're they're uh you

2251
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:22,560
know, we they're focusing on their

2252
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:24,480
plight. Yeah. They're focusing. They

2253
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,639
don't want people to help them because

2254
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:28,320
they want that uh people to feel sorry

2255
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:30,639
for them, right? And I'm not saying

2256
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:32,400
that's you. I'm saying that's the card.

2257
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:34,400
They're literally outside the church,

2258
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:36,480
but they refuse to look up. Yeah. So,

2259
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:38,159
there's all that. It's a sanctuary, but

2260
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:40,960
they're they prefer to just be like,

2261
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:42,560
"Oh, wo is me." So, no. No. And I'm not

2262
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:44,159
And again, where it falls near stuff,

2263
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:47,040
it's just saying like that's what you

2264
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:48,800
don't want. You don't want any like it's

2265
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:51,280
almost like, you know, there's something

2266
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:54,080
that you have to let go. And this is the

2267
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:56,800
time where it's like, okay, this is kind

2268
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:59,360
of like ripping off the band-aid, but I

2269
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:01,600
have to do it. Like that kind of energy,

2270
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:04,719
especially if it is, you know, someone

2271
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:07,280
that's just not

2272
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:10,880
supportive or, you know, not good energy

2273
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:12,800
for you or anything circumstantial that

2274
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:17,120
makes you feel like you're out in the

2275
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:20,320
cold and alone and you're not supported.

2276
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:23,040
Let's focus on that. Remember, it starts

2277
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:25,280
up here, especially for you. Anyway,

2278
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:27,280
Capricorn, you're actually really good.

2279
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:29,440
Just again, don't be hard on yourself.

2280
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:31,840
All right. Anyway, uh y'all are amazing.

2281
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:34,480
I'll see you next week. Bye-bye.

2282
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:38,239
Hello, Aquarius. Thank you so much for

2283
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:40,560
being members. It is so dark. Um let's

2284
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:42,639
do this. Okay, so what I'm doing this

2285
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:44,960
week is because when I look at this

2286
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:48,320
week, it is one of those weeks that just

2287
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:49,840
sneaks right in. And yeah, Mercury's

2288
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:52,080
going retrograde. We have the Mars South

2289
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:53,760
node conjunction. Those are really big.

2290
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:55,440
Yeah,

2291
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:57,760
but there's a lot of other stuff that's

2292
01:32:55,440 --> 01:33:00,960
happening. So, when I looked at this

2293
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:04,239
week, I really did feel like uh I needed

2294
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:06,159
to do more of like a monthly, you know,

2295
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:08,320
like in your bonus spreads for the

2296
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:10,159
monthly forecast where we look over some

2297
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:11,440
themes and we pull some cards. That's

2298
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:13,360
what it really feels like. It really

2299
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:15,120
does. And again, when you've got Mars

2300
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:17,199
conjuncting the south node in Virgo and

2301
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:19,920
your eighth house of death and rebirth,

2302
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:22,320
truly new beginning for you. I mean,

2303
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:26,080
you've you you got the death card in

2304
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:27,760
your final outcome. So anyway, um let's

2305
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,960
let's see let's take a look at a couple

2306
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:30,960
things. Let's see what's going on for

2307
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:33,760
you with love and relationships. Let's

2308
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:36,719
start with that. All right. I mean you

2309
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:39,520
you have Venus in the fifth which is

2310
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:43,440
Leo's home by the way and you do have

2311
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:46,880
Mercury which is Gemini's ruler which

2312
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:48,239
Gemini rules your fifth um

2313
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:50,000
in your seventh house of partnerships

2314
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:53,520
and relationships like that's just all

2315
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:57,280
right let's get let's see

2316
01:33:53,520 --> 01:34:00,080
all right love and relationships oh you

2317
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:02,800
got the five of swords okay so there is

2318
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:04,800
something here where it truly is there

2319
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:07,679
could be something here. We're going to

2320
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:09,199
have to uh the five of swords is like

2321
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:11,760
listen

2322
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:15,120
it's it's it's a little ego based the

2323
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:17,440
five of swords and it's a little like

2324
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:19,360
it's almost like I know better and I

2325
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:21,600
know how to like it can be like

2326
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:23,520
manipulative energy. They could be like

2327
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:24,800
mental manipulation and it is because

2328
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:26,239
it's like I told you the lower

2329
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:27,520
expressions of Uranus and Gemini. All

2330
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:28,960
right. So I'm just bringing that up

2331
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,639
again. It just happens to be in your

2332
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:33,920
fifth house of love and relationships.

2333
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:36,400
Yeah. So there and this is an Aquarius

2334
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:38,400
card. Uranus and Gemini is trining Pluto

2335
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:40,800
in your sign and Pluto can be

2336
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:43,840
empowerment but it can be a little like

2337
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:45,280
extreme too. So there is something here

2338
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:47,679
that's saying like there may be

2339
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:50,639
something that happens to you where you

2340
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:52,000
feel that from a partnership

2341
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:53,440
relationship that I said is going to be

2342
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,560
one of the biggest themes for you this

2343
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:58,719
week. Or it could be you. All right.

2344
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:01,199
remember that's a five of swords where

2345
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:04,159
it's just like let's can we drop the

2346
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:05,760
swords? Can we drop the swords? Can we

2347
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:08,960
see eye to eye? Can we talk this

2348
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:12,400
through? All right. And if not, maybe

2349
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:15,760
that's the thing that we have to let go.

2350
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:18,400
You got to trust your intuition on this.

2351
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:21,679
And uh I'm going to clarify that by the

2352
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:23,840
way because I'm feeling something else

2353
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:29,920
for you too.

2354
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:32,000
Uh yeah, there it is. So when so

2355
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:34,400
basically you have the Ace of Wands.

2356
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:37,280
Okay. So like I said, you're moving into

2357
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:39,840
this new when you have a new moon in

2358
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:41,920
your sign next week in your seventh

2359
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:43,520
house of partnerships and relationships.

2360
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:46,080
You got Uranus and Gemini for the next

2361
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,760
what seven years. I mean, but you still

2362
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:49,199
have Venus in Gemini for a week. But

2363
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:51,600
anyway, you have the Ace of Wands.

2364
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:53,679
That's new. That's new beginnings, new

2365
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:55,920
opportunities when it comes to anything

2366
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:58,320
that you're passionate about. Wands are

2367
01:35:55,920 --> 01:36:02,239
Yeah. That's sexual energy, too. That's

2368
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:06,960
sexuality. That's Yeah. So, you're if

2369
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:09,840
you want that's it's there. All right.

2370
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:11,520
Looks really good. So, the fact that you

2371
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:13,760
have Mars conjunct the south node in

2372
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,520
Virgo and of course it's not going to

2373
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:17,040
apply to every Aquarius. You all have

2374
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,560
different birth charts, but yeah, the

2375
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:19,600
fact that it is in your eighth house, a

2376
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:23,199
lot of you are going to be ending

2377
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:24,639
relationships, but you see that you got

2378
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:26,400
because something else is waiting on the

2379
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:29,120
other side for you. That looks really

2380
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:31,520
good. Now, um,

2381
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:33,040
let's take a look at career.

2382
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:36,880
And if you're not here for career, let's

2383
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:40,360
call it career, purpose, or passion or

2384
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:40,360
all of the above.

2385
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:46,239
Okay. So, uh, I really need to put Oh my

2386
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:49,119
gosh.

2387
01:36:46,239 --> 01:36:51,679
Uh, so, um, if you're new, when you get

2388
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:53,760
the same card that from two different

2389
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:57,119
decks,

2390
01:36:53,760 --> 01:37:02,119
it's over 160 cards. It that's you got

2391
01:36:57,119 --> 01:37:02,119
to pay attention, okay? Um,

2392
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:07,360
you're really doubling down on that page

2393
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:09,920
of pentacles. I mean, this is saying

2394
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:11,840
this is pretty much like the theme of

2395
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:13,920
the week for you. something new. And

2396
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:15,600
remember what I said, pentacles, your

2397
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:20,159
physical reality. So it could actually

2398
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:25,280
be a relationship, a new relationship

2399
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:30,480
that's rooting up for you. I mean, wow.

2400
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:32,719
Wow. But FYI, remember, we're talking

2401
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:34,320
about career, purpose, or passion. But

2402
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:36,320
relationships, your passion if you're

2403
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:40,960
not here for career like I said or your

2404
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:43,040
purpose, soulmate energy,

2405
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:45,280
just letting you know fifth house is

2406
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:47,280
soulmate.

2407
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:49,600
But anyway, because it is career like

2408
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:52,480
yeah, money, new jobs, new career,

2409
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:54,400
promotion, starting a new thing. You're

2410
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:57,440
good. Health. Let's see what's going on

2411
01:37:54,400 --> 01:38:01,159
for you with health.

2412
01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:01,159
Aquarius. Oh.

2413
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:06,159
Ah,

2414
01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:08,320
I love it. Four of swords. Yeah. So,

2415
01:38:06,159 --> 01:38:10,400
remember there's a lot of stimulating

2416
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:12,320
mercurial energy that's happening this

2417
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:14,159
week. And then you have Mars conjunct

2418
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:17,119
the south node in Virgo and your eighth

2419
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:18,960
that is very psychological, very

2420
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:21,440
forensic. It's like there's even like

2421
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:24,719
secrets you want to dig up and things

2422
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:26,639
like that. But no, just have that

2423
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:29,360
stillness that I talked about earlier.

2424
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:31,360
Okay. Four of swords is stillness of

2425
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:33,520
mind. It's like equilibrium of the mind.

2426
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:37,040
It's just it is rest and retreat. It is

2427
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:39,360
like let me realign, work with my

2428
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:41,679
chakras, all of that. But let me just

2429
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:44,080
take that time out.

2430
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:45,760
That's connect. It's all connected.

2431
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:48,719
Mental health, emotional health,

2432
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:51,600
physical health, all it's all it's all

2433
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:53,040
connected. All right. But remember what

2434
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:55,360
I told you it starts this week. It's

2435
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:57,600
really all about the mind.

2436
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:59,760
Okay? It could have to do with

2437
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:03,119
relationships with the fact that you do

2438
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:04,800
have Mercury, the planet of the mind

2439
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:07,520
and your seventh house of partnerships

2440
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:09,760
and relationships.

2441
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:12,080
Okay. And you just got the four of

2442
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:13,600
swords, a card that's attributed to

2443
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:15,280
Libra that rules partnerships,

2444
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:17,040
relationships. You have the three of

2445
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:20,040
swords here, partnerships and

2446
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:20,040
relationships.

2447
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:24,880
And even Mars and the south node in

2448
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:27,119
Virgo, your eighth partnerships. Anyway,

2449
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:30,920
let's see the biggest message for

2450
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:30,920
Aquarius to know.

2451
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:35,920
What is the pay special attention to

2452
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:37,760
card for Aquarius?

2453
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:40,320
That's it

2454
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:43,360
for this week. It would be the uh yeah,

2455
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:45,679
nine of wands. All right. So, uh hang in

2456
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:49,199
there. You're doing a great job. Nine of

2457
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:50,960
Wands, by the way, it's all first. It's

2458
01:39:49,199 --> 01:39:52,639
a Sagittarius card. It's actually

2459
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:56,000
attributed moon in Sagittarius. So, it's

2460
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:58,159
all about you and your feelings and

2461
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,480
emotions and things that bring you

2462
01:39:58,159 --> 01:40:02,159
comfort and peace of mind. Yeah, it's

2463
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:04,560
all about peace of mind about your

2464
01:40:02,159 --> 01:40:07,119
future hopes, your future long-term

2465
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:09,440
goals, wishes, dreams. That's what

2466
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:10,560
Sagittarius rules for your 11th. So,

2467
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:13,679
there's something here we're saying

2468
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:15,920

2471
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:20,880
that you want. Remember, you're going

2472
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:24,960

2473
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:27,840
process right now. Okay? You you you are

2475
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:32,480

2476
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:37,119

2477
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:39,679

2478
01:40:37,119 --> 01:40:41,840
and

2479
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:44,480
the one the solar eclipse in Virgo

2480
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:46,480
that's happening in September that are

2481
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:48,239
really big

2482
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:50,239
and it's good. It's actually really

2483
01:40:48,239 --> 01:40:51,360
great when you look at everything when

2484
01:40:50,239 --> 01:40:53,600
you do the math for everything else.

2485
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:56,719
Yeah, it's great. So, I'll even clarify

2486
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:58,800
that nine of wands for you. It does feel

2487
01:40:56,719 --> 01:41:02,080
like there is something that this week

2488
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:06,800
that you may be going through. You've

2489
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:09,760

2490
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:11,920

2491
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:13,440
then you even got that four of swords.

2492
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:14,960

2493
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:17,520
chakras, even just think mind, body,

2494
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:19,679
spirit, even with that nine of wands,

2495
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:22,159
there is something here that's really

2496
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:24,320

2497
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:26,320

01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:35,119
future. Um, all right. So, I was going

2501
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:38,199
to clarify that nine of wands.

2502
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:38,199

It's new beginnings, new ways of

2518
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:27,440
thinking. Everything I told you that's

2519
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:29,840
happening, but also contracts.

2520
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:32,480
Something's coming through.

2521
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:34,159
agreements. You're good. Aquarius,

week. All right. Bye-bye.

2524
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:40,880
Hello, Pisces. Thank you so much for

01:42:39,199 --> 01:42:42,239

2526
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:45,040

2527
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:48,159
like bang out like, you know, I do 24

2528
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:49,520
videos a week and I'm just like, ah. Um,

2529
01:42:48,159 --> 01:42:51,520
that's why this week I'm just going to

2530
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:53,760
do something different and do something

2531
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:57,679
special for you because listen, this

2532
01:42:53,760 --> 01:43:01,040
week is one of those weeks, like I said.

2533
01:42:57,679 --> 01:43:04,400
It may feel quiet when you know on paper

2534
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:08,560
it looks quiet, but there it's not. It's

2535
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:10,159
not. There's so much happening. Um,

2536
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:11,760
especially for you. I mean, you got the

2537
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:13,600
moon in your sign. You got the moon in

2538
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:15,520
your sign. And then you know when the

2539
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:18,080
moon moves into Gemini that's kind of a

2540
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:19,600
big big thing over the weekend. So what

2541
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:21,840
am I going to do because this week does

2542
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:23,920
feel like you know in between the new

2543
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:25,679
the you know the full moon we had the

2544
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:27,280
new moon that's coming up. I mean that's

2545
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:31,199
your sixth and 12th. There's something

2546
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:32,719
here in terms of like you and uh it's

2547
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:36,000
just something very spiritual something

2548
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:38,800
about you know how you are contributing

2549
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:41,119
to others. Yeah. To the collective with

2550
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:42,719
the work that you do. But there does

2551
01:43:41,119 --> 01:43:44,639
feel like some sort of rebirth here.

2552
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:46,159
This new you. All right. So, let's see

2553
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:47,360
what's going on for you. What I'm going

2554
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:49,920
to do is I'm going to pull them, you

2555
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:52,560
know, like I do with a with a monthly,

2556
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:53,920
you know, forecast. I'm just going to

2557
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:55,760
we're going to look at some themes here.

2558
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:57,040
So, the first thing is um love. I'm

2559
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:00,520
going to look at love and relationships

2560
01:43:57,040 --> 01:44:00,520
for you. Okay.

2561
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:09,679
All right. So, uh, yeah. So, if you're

2562
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:11,440
new, by the way,

2563
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:13,440
when you get the same card from two

2564
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:15,280
different decks, you really want to pay

2565
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:16,639
attention. The universe is really

2566
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:19,360
telling you something here, right? This

2567
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:21,760
is over 160 cards in in your final

2568
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:25,679
outcome. So, you got the two of wands

2569
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:28,960
twice. Yeah. So what's really

2570
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:31,600
interesting is I kept feeling and it's

2571
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:33,760
right there in front of me that Aries

2572
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:36,239
part of your chart with where Saturn is

2573
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:38,960
conjuncting Neptune. Okay. And you got

2574
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:40,239
Chiron, you have Aries, you have Saras

2575
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:42,320
there. You have so much happening in

2576
01:44:40,239 --> 01:44:44,320
that area of your chart. I'm just like

2577
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:47,679
you you've got to there's something here

2578
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:49,840
about you about you with all the North

2579
01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:53,679
Node activations happening in your sign

2580
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:55,840
about you. Okay. Uh

2581
01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:57,520
and the other thing is and I say that

2582
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:59,920
because two of wands is attributed to

2583
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:04,320
Mars in Aries and so it's actually a

2584
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:06,560
very strong card and money. Yeah, money

2585
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:08,480
is a big thing. You've got Mars, you

2586
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:10,480
know, conjuncting the south node in your

2587
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:14,880
seventh. Sure, partnerships, but it's

2588
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:16,880
still like in Virgo. So with Mercury and

2589
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:18,159
Leo in your six, it's Virgo's home.

2590
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:21,440
There's something here with money and

2591
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:23,840
career anyway. um and finances. But this

2592
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:28,239
is just saying yes,

2593
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:31,760
plan. Don't make big moves this week.

2594
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:34,000
Plan. Okay. You got that new moon next

2595
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:35,440
week.

2596
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,719
And it seems like that's what you're

2597
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:40,480
going to do anyway with all these

2598
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:42,320
retrogrades. Now, um

2599
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:43,520
let's look at career. Yeah. And if

2600
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:45,760
you're not here for career, if you're

2601
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:48,719
not here, you know, uh let's just say

2602
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:52,760
career, purpose, and passion. Okay.

2603
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:52,760
career purpose or passion.

2604
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:59,960
Okay.

2605
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:59,960
What is going on?

2606
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:05,199
I don't I don't think this is okay. So,

2607
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:07,040
you got two but what are the chances?

2608
01:46:05,199 --> 01:46:08,880
Two of the same. Okay. So, the Queen of

2609
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:11,600
Swords career, there's your fairness.

2610
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:13,119
There's your Right. And again,

2611
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:15,040
everything that's happening here, it

2612
01:46:13,119 --> 01:46:16,719
just makes sense. There's something here

2613
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:20,400
like a contract or agreement. There's

2614
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:23,920
something here um where you it you

2615
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:25,280
justice must be served. It must be

2616
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:27,520
served. There's something here that

2617
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:29,520
there's got to be something fair because

2618
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:31,920
you are feeling this confidence, this

2619
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:34,639
self-worth, right? There's something

2620
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:37,920
here that and if you don't get it, it's

2621
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:40,320
like no. And then you have this,

2622
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:41,679
you know, but you're you're you're going

2623
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:44,719
to want it. You're going to be fighting

2624
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:48,400
for it. Okay. Um, and the Queen of

2625
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:50,560
Swords, she's she's tough and she leaves

2626
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:51,920
all her emotions at the door. Yeah.

2627
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:54,480
Because she doesn't want her emotions to

2628
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:56,080
clutter judgment. So, she can see very

2629
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:57,840
clearly. I mean, this is singular

2630
01:46:56,080 --> 01:47:00,480
thought here. You even see the sword

2631
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:04,000
pointed straight to the cosmos, straight

2632
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:06,080
to the divine, okay, with with the queen

2633
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:08,080
of swords. Okay, not tilted. It's

2634
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:10,080
straight. So, yeah, again, very

2635
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:13,719
spiritual week for you. Anyway, let's uh

2636
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:13,719
look at uh health.

2637
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:18,400
It does look like health and

2638
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:20,800
relationships for you too by the way.

2639
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:25,679
That may be a big thing. But let's see.

2640
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:28,560
Oh, you got the fool. So, it does look

2641
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:31,600
like when it comes to health,

2642
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:34,000
there is a reset for you. All right. And

2643
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:35,600
I encourage it even when you have Mars

2644
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:39,920
conjuncting the south node. Remember,

2645
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:42,239
Mars is energy and passion and drive and

2646
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:44,960
physicality. So there can be something

2647
01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:47,679
here where you're really thinking about

2648
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:50,560
like again it can just be like end of a

2649
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:53,199
phase in a relationship new phase one

2650
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:55,280
that is just so like but even if you're

2651
01:47:53,199 --> 01:47:57,600
single or if you're looking or you know

2652
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:59,040
in a relationship all of that it doesn't

2653
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:02,000
really matter when it comes to health

2654
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:03,760
there is just some revival there's this

2655
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,400
you know what I said earlier there's

2656
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:08,960
almost like this rebirth you're seeing

2657
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:10,800
something that is going to improve all

2658
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:13,360
of it physical health mental health,

2659
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:16,159
emotional health, but it only starts

2660
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:18,639
when you take that leap of faith, when

2661
01:48:16,159 --> 01:48:21,119
you take that risk, when you're ready

2662
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:24,000
for this new journey.

2663
01:48:21,119 --> 01:48:27,199
And it seems like you will be.

2664
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:28,960
Okay. But the fool is another card that,

2665
01:48:27,199 --> 01:48:30,960
you know, just like the hanged man, it's

2666
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:34,880
like

2667
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:36,560
I'm not bringing the past with me. Okay.

2668
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:38,400
So, it just makes a lot of sense with,

2669
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:40,159
you know, Mars on this south node in

2670
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:43,199
Virgo.

2671
01:48:40,159 --> 01:48:45,679
that rules, you know, natively health.

2672
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:47,840
So, the last card, what is the biggest

2673
01:48:45,679 --> 01:48:50,719
message for Pisces? Oh, sun, moon, and

2674
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:53,719
rising. Uh, the pay special attention to

2675
01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:53,719
card.

2676
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:59,440
Mhm.

2677
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:03,040
All right. So, uh, yeah,

2678
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:05,199
you're you're good. Uh, this and another

2679
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:07,440
card that's been coming out a lot, but

2680
01:49:05,199 --> 01:49:09,920
in the second spread, it's just so

2681
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:12,880
interesting. You got the Queen of Wands.

2682
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:15,760
So, the Queen of Wands, uh,

2683
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:19,520
it's very Venus and Gemini energy to be

2684
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:21,280
honest, but also all this Leo energy,

2685
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:23,520
too.

2686
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:26,239
I love it. I love this. Okay, remember

2687
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:28,880
Leo, there's a sense there's like royal

2688
01:49:26,239 --> 01:49:31,520
royal maker. There's a sense of fame and

2689
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:33,119
attraction. That magnetic energy that I

2690
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:35,679
said that you're going to feel with

2691
01:49:33,119 --> 01:49:37,440
Venus and Gemini, too. a lot of mental

2692
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:41,199
connection here especially with Mercury

2693
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:43,119
right uh in Leo but queen of wands she

2694
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:47,440
is a magnet people gravitate toward her

2695
01:49:43,119 --> 01:49:49,920
she gets whatever she wants and so how

2696
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:53,360
because a she knows how the law of

2697
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:55,679
attraction works it's what I say all the

2698
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:58,400
time vibrate at the high frequency

2699
01:49:55,679 --> 01:50:00,560
that's you know and then put out there

2700
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:03,360
what you want back but the biggest thing

2701
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:06,480
of all I mean with this being your card

2702
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:08,159
of you know the biggest message,

2703
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:12,080
confidence,

2704
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:15,440
confidence. She radiates.

2705
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:18,639
She that's why people they see her light

2706
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:20,159
and so have that confidence and you're

2707
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:22,320
going to get everything that you want.

2708
01:50:20,159 --> 01:50:23,920
And you see that here anyway. And you

2709
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:27,920
know the two queens that you got here

2710
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:29,520
that's I mean you got three queens, four

2711
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:31,280
queens actually with two of the queen of

2712
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:33,440
swords. Wow. Queen of pentacles, queen

2713
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:37,199
of wands, queen of swords. that's very

2714
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:40,560
like Saras Juno

2715
01:50:37,199 --> 01:50:42,800
um Saras and Aerys and Aries. I mean

2716
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:44,960
there's just a lot here where it's like

2717
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:48,560
a lot of that divine feminine energy but

2718
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:51,119
leadership ownership. Yeah.

2719
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:53,360
I love this. Have that ownership.

2720
01:50:51,119 --> 01:50:55,920

want me I I'm going to do something

2726
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:07,600
here. I I really want to clarify that uh

2727
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:09,600
seven of pentacles.

2728
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:11,600
Welcome to tier three. I mean, and you

2729
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:14,560
know, if you are a member, like I I do

2730
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:15,920
this often, clarify something from But I

2731
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:19,080
do want to see that seven of pentacles

2732
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:19,080
for you.

2733
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:26,480
I have a feeling I know what it is, but

2734
01:51:23,119 --> 01:51:30,880
let me um Yeah.

2735
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:32,960
Mhm. Okay. You got the five of cups.

2736
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:34,639
There's uh you're either there's

2737
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:36,159
something there's again something

2738
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:40,080
ending.

2739
01:51:36,159 --> 01:51:41,760
It's just you've got to let the past go.

2740
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:44,239
But it seems like if you're the one

2741
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:45,760
that's going to end something or try to

2742
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:47,520
have a conversation about adjusting

2743
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:49,360
something, whether it is love, whether

2744
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:53,119
it is career, whether it's, you know,

2745
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:57,199
with a a friendship, whatever it is, it

2746
01:51:53,119 --> 01:52:01,520
does seem like that person may not be

2747
01:51:57,199 --> 01:52:02,880
happy with the decision. Okay. Um, and

2748
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:04,320
you know, it could be you too, but I

2749
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:06,719
just don't see you looking back to the

2750
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:08,480
past. I see you ready to move forward.

2751
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:10,960
So again, that's in your external

2752
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:13,920
factors area. Okay, I'll clarify that.

2753
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:15,360
Five of cups, too. I'm very I have I

2754
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:18,920
love y'all, Pisces. I love y'all,

2755
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:18,920
Pisces. All right.

2756
01:52:19,210 --> 01:52:25,199
[Music]

2757
01:52:21,199 --> 01:52:28,320
What is it? Tell me. Yeah. Okay. There

2758
01:52:25,199 --> 01:52:31,040
that there's your affirmation with that

2759
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:32,719
three of uh with that three of swords.

2760
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:35,520
So again, all of this in your external

2761
01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:37,440
factors area

2762
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:39,440
there's going to there's and this again

2763
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:41,840
three of swords is a Libra card by the

2764
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:43,520
way. Yeah. So another Libra card and

2765
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:46,080
then the five of cups is you know

2766
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:48,800
actually attributed to Mars in Scorpio

2767
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:50,239
and so you remember Scorpio natively

2768
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:52,960
rules the eighth which is like

2769
01:52:50,239 --> 01:52:55,360
partnerships and relationships but

2770
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:58,239
building like there's this depth and

2771
01:52:55,360 --> 01:53:00,080
intensity there.

2772
01:52:58,239 --> 01:53:02,080
Remember what I just said. You're going

2773
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:03,920
to have all these, you know, the Libra

2774
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:07,280
activations

2775
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:09,840
19 degrees, 7 degrees, but Mars will be

2776
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:12,960
moving into Libra next month in your

2777
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:15,440
eighth house. All right. So, there's so

2778
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:18,239
this is actually good because it just

2779
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:19,679
feels like it's necessary. There's

2780
01:53:18,239 --> 01:53:22,400
something here that's necessary. Like

2781
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:24,159
you're ready for something new.

2782
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:26,800
So, just keep that in mind. But it does

2783
01:53:24,159 --> 01:53:28,239
feel like it's going to be someone like,

2784
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:30,880
you know, there's going to be something

2785
01:53:28,239 --> 01:53:32,880
there where someone could be a little

2786
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:34,960
like, "No,

2787
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:36,320
you are my best employee." You know?

2788
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:39,199
Anyway, all right, Pisces. Y'all are

2789
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:39,199
amazing. I'll see you next He better.
