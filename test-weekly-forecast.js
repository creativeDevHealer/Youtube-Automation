    "transcript": "00:00\nHello Taurus. Welcome to your weekly reading for July 14th to the 20th. This\n\n00:06\nis for Taurus sun, moon, and rising. And we are just gonna jump right in. Taurus, uh, yeah, that you're going to love this\n\n00:12\nweek, but also you're going to love this week. So, uh, this week, first of all, I\n\n00:17\ndo want to congratulate you. I wish I had a lot more time to, you know, sit here and talk with y'all because you you\n\n00:25\nyou got Uranus out of your sign. And I can't even begin to tell you how big of\n\n00:31\na deal that is. That was since 2018. And remember what I said last week and even in your monthly forecast that it's not\n\n00:37\neasy having Uranus in your sign, but you know, because it brings shakeups and whatnot. Um, there could have been a\n\n00:44\nlittle bit of like ups and downs, right, since 2018. However, you come out on the\n\n00:49\nother side stronger and and more confident and a lot of great things have\n\n00:54\nhappened to you too. You know, u as I always say like if you're a Taurus sun,\n\n01:00\num you know, sometimes a lot of the aspects that happen aren't about you. They that would be more your rising. It\n\n01:05\nwould be more about like, you know, circumstances happening in your life with people that you know or you know,\n\n01:10\nuh career purpose, things like that. But you've had a lot of shakeups. But look at where you're at now. Okay? even the\n\n01:17\npast few years there were so many other great things happening for you. So I'm very happy I'm very happy for you very\n\n01:23\nexcited for you and you're about to have some bonkers stuff happen with uh money for the next seven years. It's going to\n\n01:29\nbe amazing. And I want to also congratulate you because you were the first to enter this brand new era that\n\n01:36\nwe're moving into along with everyone else on this planet. And this is all thanks to the rare\n\n01:42\nminrine that I've talked about and I'm officially going to give it a name. Okay. Uh, I'm going to call it the prism\n\n01:48\nportal. What do you think about that? Tell me. Tell me, Taurus. I want your honest opinion. But anyway, it is Saturn\n\n01:54\nconjuncting Neptune, right? You know, in Aries at the apex and then you have it's sexiling Uranus and Gemini, sexiling\n\n02:02\nPluto and Aquarius. And Uranus and Gemini is trining Pluto and Aquarius.\n\n02:07\nOkay. So, you have that pyramid. You have that mini trine. All right. So remember that's all that's many many\n\n02:14\nyears many years and Uranus which is all about awakening and and and and your\n\n02:20\nbreakthroughs trining Pluto which is all about revolution transformation. Oh you\n\n02:25\nbetter believe it. You're about to go through some major major transformation. I already told y'all uh in your annual\n\n02:31\nforecast all y'all become uh really famous. It's in your 10th house. You got Pluto in your 10th. You got and Pluto\n\n02:37\nnatively rules your seventh. So it could be you becoming really famous with another person or you're signing some\n\n02:43\nbig deal. Yeah. Seventh house is partnerships, relationships, contracts, legal matters. But then you got Gemini.\n\n02:48\nYou got Uranus in Gemini. Your second house of income s finances. That's your house. You rule the second house. It's\n\n02:54\ncomfort. It's modern comfort. It's a lot of great things that are happening for you. So you're going to start feeling\n\n02:59\nthis a little bit more strongly uh next month. But just and I'll always point out the times where it's, you know, at\n\n03:06\nits peak. Okay. For the next few years. All right. Now, the other thing is that\n\n03:11\nuh Hello, you can hear me now, right? Yeah. Yeah. I think that I told you that\n\n03:17\nI have Uranus on my ascendant. I'm a zero degree Gemini rising. So, Uranus now officially in Gemini at 0 degrees\n\n03:25\nfor a long time, shaking things up for me, uh, bringing surprises to me. and just look at the\n\n03:32\nlast live stream. I explained what happened to the mic. I could not believe it. Anyway, uh and you know, other stuff\n\n03:37\nthere, too. But here's the thing. This week, you're going to have this it's it's going to feel like this retrospective of your life, okay?\n\n03:45\nBecause what you're going to be doing, you're going to see Oh, wow. You're going to be you're going to be going deep. You're going to be going really\n\n03:52\ndeep in terms of how far you have come. Yeah. and how far you're willing to go\n\n03:58\nand what's next for you, okay? Painting this vision for yourself on your path to\n\n04:05\nenlightenment. And that's because of Uranus and Gemini, which you are now it's official as of July 7th. Okay? So,\n\n04:11\nyou're freeing your mind. You're thinking outside the box, especially when it comes to again comfort, things\n\n04:18\nthat you value, things that you just love and adore. Just, you know, self-worth, self value. A lot of you\n\n04:23\nbecoming a lot more confident. You're going to have moments that bring you a lot of confidence. Uh, and you're going to know your worth. You're going to know\n\n04:30\nyour worth. Yeah. If you know what I mean, like if you're at a job and you're just like, I should be getting paid, you\n\n04:36\nknow, uh, $30,000 more an hour, whatever it is, just like know your worth, right? But, um,\n\n04:43\nfinances, money, that's a big thing here in the second house. And don't forget, you also have Venus here in the second\n\n04:49\nhouse as well. And Venus is money, okay? And Venus is a ruler. So, you're good\n\n04:56\nthings. You got it made. I want to be your friend. And but I want you to be very social right now. Okay? I want you\n\n05:01\nto be very social. Take advantage of this with Venus and Gemini right now. Yeah. Please. Okay. You got a lot going\n\n05:07\nthrough your mind. Okay. You are expanding your consciousness. Yeah. The biggest takeaway though is remember that\n\n05:14\nUranus wants you to be your authentic self. All right. So, always remember that. And it's that authenticity that\n\n05:20\nbrings you to those higher states of uh like frequency that I always talk about love, self love, gratitude, compassion.\n\n05:28\nJust be you, right? And ju your soul. It's so beautiful. And I want you this\n\n05:33\nweek, I want you to see it. I want you to feel it, right? I want to feel that because here's the thing. You're going\n\n05:39\nto feel a little bit restless. And a lot of it is because there's so many things that you're going to want to move on.\n\n05:45\nBut Saturn and Neptune are retrograde. Pluto is retrograde. Mercury is going\n\n05:51\nretrograde. Yeah, you've got Saturn, Neptune in your 12th conjuncting. I'm\n\n05:57\ngoing about to blow your mind with a couple other things that are happening there. Yeah, that the 12th represents\n\n06:03\nthe past. Yeah. And so do the retrogrades. And then you have the Mars conjuncting of the south node in Virgo.\n\n06:10\nAnd the south node is the past. So use this. Okay. It's going to be a very\n\n06:16\nnostalgying week for you. Use it. Go within. Go inward. Okay? That's what I want you to\n\n06:23\ndo. And you know, sometimes you do need like a personal Siri or a personal\n\n06:29\nAlexa. And I'll do that for you right now, okay? And give you your weekly reminder that you are entering\n\n06:36\nunchartered territory with the Prism Portal.\n\n06:41\nAnd remember, nobody on Earth has ever experienced this. So, you're about to go through big change and experiences that\n\n06:49\nyou will never have again in your lifetime, nor will you have ever experienced in your lifetime. So, very\n\n06:54\nnew territory that you're moving into. Now, Saturn conjunct Neptune. Remember, they're both retrograde, okay? And\n\n07:00\nthey're both conjuncting. I'm going to point something out this week that it's kind of a big deal. And I want you and I know you take notes and really if\n\n07:07\nthere's any data circle in your calendar, I'm going to tell you, but um just remember that's like being realistic with your ideals, okay? It's\n\n07:13\nbringing structure to your vision. That's all it is. Okay? You're definitely a lot of y'all are becoming healers. A lot of you are becoming\n\n07:20\nhealers as in and when I say that, yes, it can be spiritual healers. It could be the work that you do. It can be even in\n\n07:26\nyour family environment. Like you are going to feel this energy and you're going to feel this calling as in like, okay, I'm meant to do this because it's\n\n07:33\nall that's it's happening in your 12th. Okay. And it's connecting with Uranus and Pluto. So, a lot of y'all are going\n\n07:39\nto make careers out of this or you already do it and you're going to feel this uh what is the word? Uh glow up or\n\n07:44\nyou know what I mean? Whatever the kids say these days. Now, reflect and review just right now this week, okay? Because\n\n07:50\nMars and Virgo, that's great for you. You you know your BFF, fellow earth sign. It's going to help you uh bring\n\n07:56\nyou grounded or you know, and the other thing is it's Virgo energy. Remember, that's very analytical. That's very like\n\n08:02\nchecking off your to-do list. Let's whistle while you work. That kind of energy. So, you're definitely going to\n\n08:07\nbe mapping things out in terms of how you're going to take charge moving forward. Okay? So, your mission if you\n\n08:14\nif you choose to accept wax on, wax off. Okay? Practice patience because again,\n\n08:20\nyou're going to want to move on a lot of things, but there's there's these planets that's saying, um, not yet. Not\n\n08:26\nyet. Okay? So, stay frosty, be cool, and reflect. This is a great time to do it.\n\n08:33\nOkay? just reflect and be still like a statue, like um the night. Be as still\n\n08:39\nas the night. Okay. Um and just do that spiritual work because I'm going to let\n\n08:44\nyou know now Taurus, when I say there's going to be things that you want to move on, there are so much fire and air\n\n08:51\nenergy this week. A lot. Okay? And so that's really good. But remember,\n\n08:58\nreflect and merge it. So when I say that really just kind of think about where\n\n09:03\nyou want your purpose all of that all the the nodes are going to be activated this week okay what's your direction\n\n09:08\nmoving forward what's your purpose moving forward your life purpose where are there any cracks okay in your plans\n\n09:16\nare you do you have sealant right so it's all about correcting course if you\n\n09:22\nchoose to right so this all for your new era being the best version of yourself in this everchanging world and you know\n\n09:28\nit's not how the world changes. It's how you make it adapt to you because you create your reality. Now, Monday, July\n\n09:35\n14th, you will see that uh yeah, that's it. Uh written in red, you're saying I'm\n\n09:42\nsee you see I'm doing something different this week. That's you're going to sub my ascended. Okay. So, um\n\n09:47\neverything written in red is what we discussed and the bonus spreads for tier three members, really good legendary\n\n09:53\nmembers. uh and that would be important lud nations, planettoids, asteroids,\n\n10:00\nfixed stars, the aspects that they're having. And so I just want to give you an idea of how you'll see how it\n\n10:09\nactually completes the story. All right? And it it's really interesting. Um but\n\n10:16\nthere were just so many this week that I was like, \"Okay, they really really have to know this.\" But here's the thing. The\n\n10:21\nother thing is if you are a tier three member, oh, we're doing something special for your spread today. All\n\n10:27\nright, so now here's the other thing. Monday, uh, that's the thing. You know that you got the sun and Jupiter in Cancer right now. The sign of Jupiter's\n\n10:35\nexaltation, you have Jupiter trying the moon. Now, I told you in your monthly forecast, Jupiter will have no aspects\n\n10:41\nthis month. What? No planetary aspects, but the lunations. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So,\n\n10:49\nthis is a big heads up for you because this is a big one because you've got remember I just told you the sun is\n\n10:55\ngoing to trine Jup uh trine the moon right or uh sorry Jupiter is going to trine the moon and uh trines are very\n\n11:01\nauspicious they're like luck magnets too they make things effortless and it's\n\n11:06\nJupiter the planet of luck so you've got Jupiter trining the moon in Pisces right\n\n11:11\nso Jupiter and cancer moon in Pisces now this is what's interesting is that um\n\n11:18\nthe Moon rules Cancer. Jupiter actually rules Pisces. Jupiter may be exalted in\n\n11:24\ncancer, but it rules Pisces. It's a ruler. So, you have this mutual reception. Oh, this is so nice. This is\n\n11:30\nabsolutely nice because what's happening here is that it is in your 11th house of\n\n11:36\nyour future hopes, wishes, your long-term goals, and commitments and your social network, your uh support\n\n11:42\nsystem, your friends, your squad, your benefactors, allies, community, all of\n\n11:47\nthat. So what's happening for you right off the bat is truly special. Truly\n\n11:53\nspecial because this is very optimistic and there's this ex uh you know expansion of opportunities.\n\n12:00\nA lot of it is going to come within. You got to remember just tap in and and and\n\n12:05\nvibrate at the high frequency. There's got to be something right off the bat shifts your perspective. And there's got\n\n12:10\nto be something here that really has to do with um what you want for your future, but also\n\n12:17\nsomething that you want to communicate. And there may be some family energy here, home energy here. There's a lot of\n\n12:23\nfocus there for you, okay? But also, you want to launch things, you want to do things. You're going to feel this huge\n\n12:29\ncuriosity, especially if you want to connect with the masses. You're going to be thinking about that today. And that\n\n12:36\ncan even be, you know, just a community, right? What do I want to do with, you know, I want to launch a community. I\n\n12:42\nwant to launch the, you know, goldfish club of uh Cincinnati, Ohio. Whatever it is, whatever you want, there's something\n\n12:48\nspecial for you this day. Okay? Now, remember from last week with all the\n\n12:53\nNorth Node activations in Pisces, that was 19°, right? All those activations, the Libra degree, this is at 7°, which\n\n13:00\nis the other Libra degree. So there is something here that's just really remarkable in terms of there's it's it's\n\n13:08\nkind of like what you do what you want. It's just I want to change my life and this is how I want it to be. And you're\n\n13:13\ngoing to feel it this day. Okay. And there really is something special with the number seven. You know there's something really spiritual about it. The\n\n13:18\nlucky number seven. It's a prime number. It's it's special. Yeah. You're going to be zoned in. Why? Because Thursday\n\n13:27\nuh July 15th. Wait a minute. That's not the right day. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, Tuesday, July 15th, the next day.\n\n13:33\nUm, that's when you have the moon conjunct the north node in Pisces.\n\n13:39\nSo again, all those north node conjunctions from last week, it was really building up to this moment. And\n\n13:44\nso this day you're going to feel wo very soulful, very inspired, imaginative,\n\n13:49\neven dreamy about dreaming about your future, dreaming about it. And take that\n\n13:54\ntime today to think about where you want to be by February 2026. Okay? where you\n\n14:00\nwant to be by in two years, in five years. Great for vision boards this day. Remember this is beautiful and there is\n\n14:07\nthis element of like now you're getting an idea of what you are going to release when we get to the Mars, you know, south\n\n14:12\nnode conjunction. But this is the moon conjuncting the north node in Pisces. So there's this karmic alignment of your\n\n14:19\ndestiny, your destined, you know, future, your mission statement, your life purpose. There's emotional growth\n\n14:26\nwith this and there is this aspect of just this clarity of like what I do want\n\n14:31\nto release. Um and there's I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of you are just having this urge to meet new people.\n\n14:37\nYeah. Especially with Uranus and uh Venus and Gemini. I would not be\n\n14:43\nsurprised if you just start meeting people. All right. That and and remember\n\n14:48\nthis is a nodes of fate. So whatever it would be would be faded. Yeah. So, I\n\n14:53\nlove this. And there is a sense of collected missions for you. Now, this is where it gets a little bit more like,\n\n14:59\nokay, Taurus, you win. You already win. Um, you've got Juno trining the the\n\n15:04\nnorth node and the moon today. So, the moon conjuncting the north node. Juno will be trining that. And Juno is\n\n15:13\nsettled into Scorpio right now. Juno is Jupiter's wife.\n\n15:19\nSo, great day. and Juno, we'll talk about her later because there's another asset,\n\n15:24\nbut just remember Juno, Jupiter's wife. Juno is a dwarf planet just like um you know, Pluto. So, big deal, big deal\n\n15:31\nhere. But Juno is all about truth, justice, the balance of power in\n\n15:36\nrelationships and partnerships and contracts and legal matters. So, there's something here. There's something here\n\n15:43\nwhere it's just something is it just feels really pure to you. All right. as\n\n15:49\nincluding again you're you're realizing what have I got to cut you know to make\n\n15:54\nthis dream happen and so it doesn't even end it's just this day it's like you've got the moon trying the sun too\n\n16:02\nthere's something here home family contracts leases agreements or something here you're thinking about something\n\n16:07\nthat may happen there's something here where you're going to feel the love you're going to feel the love and you're going to be very communicative I\n\n16:13\nwouldn't be surprised if you're traveling a little bit could even be like a little day trip with your friends or family or your sister um or brother.\n\n16:21\nAll right? Or it may be even like with your neighbor to be honest. I mean, you do have Mercury and Leo in your fourth and we'll talk about that in a second.\n\n16:28\nBut I love this. It's just a very emotionally moving emotionally moving time for you. And then when we get to\n\n16:33\nJuly 16th, this is when you're really going to go deep, okay? And it's because\n\n16:39\nyou've got the moon in Aries now. And the moon is just moving into Aries.\n\n16:46\nTherefore, will conjunct Saturn and Neptune. So, you have a triple conjunction with the moon, Saturn, and\n\n16:51\nNeptune in Aries in your 12th. So, all this dreamy energy, remember the\n\n16:58\nnorth node in Pisces, what did I say? That's already spiritual energy, right? Because 12 uh Pisces natively rules the\n\n17:05\n12th. So, there's a handoff here. everything that you're dreaming about the first few days of this week. It's\n\n17:11\nlike this day. It's like remember it's that pioneering spirit that Aries is that entrepreneur, that leader, that\n\n17:18\nspiritual leader, the compassionate hero with Saturn and Neptune here and with the moon here. Oh, you're going to feel\n\n17:24\nfired up. You're going to feel fired up. You're like, I want to be the role model. I want to be the hero. I want to\n\n17:29\nbe the leader. It's amazing. Okay. So, you're going to feel this energy, your inner, you know, Gandhi or Ted Lasso. It\n\n17:37\ndoesn't matter. Just, you know, you do you now. Uh, and you're going to go deep. You're, it's your 12th. You're going to go deep. And remember all the\n\n17:43\nretrogrades that are already happening. Yeah. You're going to be thinking of the past, reflecting on the past, having nostalgic moments. You're also going to\n\n17:50\nhave a little bit of time. You're going to have some moment. You're going to probably take a little break from, you know, your your your friends or your\n\n17:57\ncolleagues wherever you are. just, you know, maybe you're going to go outside and just do a little walk around the the block about five minutes because you're\n\n18:04\ngoing to want a little bit of like, oh, there's a lot h like on my mind. Let me just process this now. Thursday, July\n\n18:10\n17th. Um, and I encourage that just where we Okay, so Thursday, July 17th.\n\n18:15\nSo, another thing that we just, you know, we'll talk about the we always talk about the second spread. Now you got the sun square AS.\n\n18:22\nAnd remember Ays is Mars's sister, the divine feminine goddess warrior,\n\n18:30\nand she's right on top of Chiron, the wounded healer.\n\n18:36\nAnd that's the other thing. Chiron's now in the mix. So you see everything that's happening in the past for you, right?\n\n18:42\nThat's coming back, whether in a nostalgic way, but now you have Chiron, which has to do with the past as well.\n\n18:49\nAnd the sun is squaring Aerys and therefore will square Chiron, you know,\n\n18:54\non Thursday. So, let me just tell you about Aerys. Remember, I've I've brought her up before, you know, you remember\n\n19:01\nyour mythology, right? She's the one who threw the golden apple at the wedding to stir things up. But all in the name of\n\n19:08\ngood. Okay. All in the name of of of good. Uh what needs to be improved or\n\n19:13\nfixed or be fair for inclusiveness. She fights for those without power, without\n\n19:20\na voice like Robin Hood. Okay. And so there is\n\n19:25\nsomething here. There is truly something here where I would not be surprised.\n\n19:31\nYou're going to go really deep. And it's almost like with Aries here, any old wounds that you have, anything that\n\n19:38\nthere's 12th house could be like self-sabotage as well, hidden enemies, things like that. any old wounds that\n\n19:43\nyou have. Aries is trying she's gonna be like you got to rip off the band-aid now. All right, because remember she's a\n\n19:49\nwarrior. She's like that's a chicken scratch, right? And so there's something\n\n19:54\nhere where it feels with the sun in cancer in your third house. You're going\n\n20:00\nto you're going to you're going to want to talk you're going to want to talk and\n\n20:05\ntalk talk okay with the people that you trust. Again, there's a lot of family energy that's happening for you here.\n\n20:11\nAnd it could be something that actually has to do with family. Yeah. Or something that has to do with uh something that an idea that you have or\n\n20:17\nsomething that you're launching or there's something here that you just need to heal. Okay. There's something\n\n20:24\nthat may be taking up a lot of your mental space. Third house is also the mind. So, just keep that in mind. Do\n\n20:29\nwhat you need to do. Yeah. do it because honestly Mars and Pluto this day to be\n\n20:38\nhonest are not really getting along. Okay, so they're maybe just again\n\n20:43\nsomething here with partnerships and relationships. Remember you have Juno in the mix as well. So there's something there you may be fighting for fairness\n\n20:49\nand a partnership relationship and that can be work love. It can be a personal relationship yeah with your um I don't\n\n20:57\nknow neighbor but just remember everything is energy. All right. So those high frequencies. All right. Now\n\n21:04\nthe other thing is and it's not even on the whiteboard. So I just told you what's happening in\n\n21:11\nthe 12th house area of your chart. So I just told you that day. All right. And\n\n21:16\nnow the past two days with Neptune and Saturn and Aerys and Chiron are all in\n\n21:25\nyour 12th house right now. So is Saras. So that's five heavenly bodies that are\n\n21:32\ndoing, you know, they're having a party in your 12th house, which is spirituality. It is intuition. It's also\n\n21:40\njust it's rest and retreat. That's why I'm saying you're going to probably go around the block. You're going to need some like, okay, I need to just for I\n\n21:46\nneed a little time for myself today to process things. Yeah, that's a lot\n\n21:52\nhappening. Okay, that's a lot happening. So again, let things come out. And\n\n21:57\nagain, you have a lot of retrogrades and you have a lot happening your 12th that has to do with the past anyway. A lot of\n\n22:04\nthings are going to come up from the past. Even things that could have been patterns or habits and just things that\n\n22:10\nyou may recognize, things that you may tell yourself that you're hold that that are holding you\n\n22:15\nback. This is the day to tap into your inner warrior, okay, with Aries here and\n\n22:21\nto say, \"This is what I'm going to leave behind.\" Yeah. This is what I'm going to leave behind. Okay. So, it's very\n\n22:29\nempowering. Now, Friday the 18th and actually Thursday, too, because\n\n22:34\nMercury will go retrograde right around midnight. So, it depends on where you live. But Friday the 18th, Mercury will\n\n22:40\nbe retrograde in Leo until August 11th. And by the way, if you want some good\n\n22:47\nnews, if you if you want to mark this in your calendar, and of course, we'll talk about it soon. that day, August 11th, is\n\n22:53\nwhen we do have Venus conjunct Jupiter. It's once a year. The two bonific\n\n22:59\nplanets in a conjunction. Okay. So, again, that would be your third house. Uh but there's, you know, natively\n\n23:05\nthat's your, you know, eth. So, what does that even mean for you? It means like you're probably signing a big\n\n23:11\ncontract. All right? or you're uh moving into a new home or you're you know what\n\n23:16\nI mean like signing a lease or you're launching something or you're doing like uh something online launching something\n\n23:23\nonline maybe even social media maybe some branding stuff here you a business you've been working on a new brand maybe\n\n23:29\neven working on like logos and uh advertising marketing sales sales uh and\n\n23:36\nmaybe a trip you're taking around that time but anyway we'll talk about then but uh so Mercury is going retrograde in\n\n23:41\nyour 11th Oh, sorry. In your fourth house. So again, you see how there's so much home stuff happening for you\n\n23:47\nbecause that's your fourth house. So that's spotlighted now. And now Mercury going retrograde. Yeah. Now that's you\n\n23:54\nknow 15 million retrogrades happening on this day for you know this week with all\n\n24:00\nthese planets in your 12th that has to do with the past. So spend that time go\n\n24:07\nwithin. It's all about reassessing these retrogrades. Think about the reword. Reassess. reevaluate, reconsider, redo.\n\n24:13\nRemember, Mars and Virgo is helping you, okay? It likes to like, you know, uh, break out the Trello board. So, just,\n\n24:20\nyou know, do do your thing, okay? Because when Mercury does go direct in August, I can tell you right now, it's\n\n24:26\ngoing to be like a bullet train. All right? There's fiery fiery air and fire August, okay? So, uh, embrace this, slow\n\n24:34\ndown because you're going to need it. There's going to be things that you may have overlooked. That's why these are\n\n24:39\nreally good retrogrades, really important retrogrades. And remember, you started entering this new era recently.\n\n24:45\nSo, a lot of new energies that you needed to slow down anyway. And this is the perfect time. Think about the first\n\n24:52\ntwo weeks of July like things have been and a lot of this is creative projects too. But again, big emphasis on home,\n\n24:58\nfamily, real estate matters. You may uh you know, even a relationship with a\n\n25:04\nrealtor you're working with. Whatever it is, just at the end of the day, it's Uranus and Gemini. That's again, you're\n\n25:11\nalready reinventing yourself is all I'm saying. So, this is really helpful. Focus on your future while you delve\n\n25:18\ninto the past. All right. And Uranus and Gemini again, 0 degrees. Think of like the fool card, right? That you got that\n\n25:24\nlast week, didn't you? You did. In your future. So, new way of thinking, ideas, creativity, curiosity, change, freeing\n\n25:31\nyourself, having your breakthrough. Okay, your Kate and Leo moment, the helm\n\n25:37\nof the it's all about liberating yourself and being your authentic self. Uh, so here's the other thing is that\n\n25:44\nthere's just the fact that Mercury's retrograde in Leo, it just automatically brings\n\n25:50\npassion. That's Leo energy. So again, you could be have a I already told you\n\n25:56\nthat a lot of people from your past going to be coming back. Okay. A lot of it even family members that you haven't talked to in a long time, they're going\n\n26:02\nto be showing up in your DMs at your door, right? Aunt, uh, Thelma, whoever, right? Whoever it is. But the other\n\n26:08\nthing is like you may be going back to things that you were working on that you got maybe got too busy. Creative\n\n26:14\nprojects or maybe you were designing a home. Maybe you were thinking about redecorating something in your, you\n\n26:20\nknow, place. There's there's sandwich here. There's sandwich here for you. Use this because, uh, it's going to be\n\n26:27\nreally good for you. I told you this one one of the I like this Mercury retrograde and sure it of course Mercury\n\n26:32\nretrograde happens three to four times a year we've we've experienced it all the time\n\n26:39\nso I don't even have to go through that you know that there's going to be you know maybe some miscommunication crosswires uh delays travel delays\n\n26:46\nthings like that just now you know so now that you know it's in your consciousness it's not that going to be\n\n26:52\nthat much of a surprise if it does happen so you will always want to be responsive not reactive all Okay. Now,\n\n26:58\none last thing for you, particularly you Taurus, is I want you to think back to the summer of 2023\n\n27:05\nbecause your ruling planet was Venus or is Venus and was retrograde in Leo at\n\n27:10\nthat time. So, of course, the sky was very different back then. But it would just be very curious to see. You may see\n\n27:19\nthe same themes come up around this time is all I'm saying. Okay. Just little things again, just little patterns. Who\n\n27:26\ndid come back? What were creative projects that you went back to? What did happen with home? What were the\n\n27:32\nconversations you were having? It's Mercury, you know, communication about home and family and love. Anyway, FYI.\n\n27:40\nOkay. Uh the other thing is that uh yeah, just get things in writing too if you're, you know, talking about buying a\n\n27:46\nhouse and things like that. Uh remember, you don't want to sign on a house when Mercury's retrograde. So just you can\n\n27:53\nyou can it's just suggested you don't you go with your intuition. So uh\n\n28:02\nI see also for you Taurus that it is very possible\n\n28:08\nyou're going to be making up making amends with family members as well during this Mercury retrograde period.\n\n28:14\nOkay. Now, um, one last thing.\n\n28:20\nDo I need to tell you this? Okay, I'm going to tell you this.\n\n28:25\nSo, remember the prism portal. It's happening now. And remember, I said\n\n28:32\nthis summer, put yourself, take action. Where do you want to be by February 2026 when Saturn and Neptune conjunct to 0\n\n28:38\ndegrees and it's a great reset. So, you want to do that now. You want to take advantage of everything now over the\n\n28:44\nsummer. I just told you Mercury will go retrograde this week until August 11th.\n\n28:50\nAnd at that point for Mercury is still going to be in Leo, but then we'll leave Leo September 2nd.\n\n28:59\nSo, not only do you have this four-way alignment with Saturn, Neptune, Uranus,\n\n29:04\nPluto all summer long, now you have Mercury on top of that in the same sign.\n\n29:10\nand Mercury will be aspecting the other planets too. So when I say home and\n\n29:15\nfamily is a big thing for you with Jupiter and Cancer with Mercury and like\n\n29:21\nyou you better believe it. Okay. So where do you want to be? Make the plans.\n\n29:26\nMake the plans because Mercury will move into Virgo in September. That's going to\n\n29:32\nbe a big deal. We'll talk about it. I I already told you we have eclipse season in September. You got some big changes\n\n29:37\ncoming. Okay. You got some really, really, really big changes coming. In fact, it seems like a lot of y'all, you\n\n29:44\nknow that thing that some people do where like when you meet someone, when you fall in love, it's your soulmate,\n\n29:51\nand then you spend all your time with that person and just never see your friends.\n\n29:58\nThat's going to happen for a lot of y'all, okay, this year. Just letting you know. It's not like you're going to\n\n30:03\ncompletely, you know, it's just like there's going to be that's something that's happening. All right. Especially\n\n30:09\nover when we get to the fall. Um, and then next week you even have like, oh my\n\n30:16\ngosh, some of y'all are really moving. Some of y'all are really moving or talking about it right now or buying a home. You're talking about it right now.\n\n30:22\nAnd then remember, I'll leave the Saturn Neptune video for you at the end of this video because I told you I told you\n\n30:28\nabout next summer and how that's such a big deal for you. It's s y'all are\n\n30:34\nmoving. Y'all are moving. Okay. Or having babies.\n\n30:40\nTherefore, you have to get a bigger place. Or there's something here where you're just buying property. I you have\n\n30:46\nremember Jupiter and Leo will trine Saturn and Aries next year. We have a\n\n30:51\nnew moon solar eclipse in Leo next year. Over the summer, we have the\n\n30:58\nSouth Node moving into Leo next. So, a lot of y'all are moving, okay, within a year. Um, and for like you're going to\n\n31:06\nlove it. Now, fixed signs, uh, if you're a crosswatcher, by the way, if you watch for rising or your moon for your, you\n\n31:12\nknow, uh, mom or your husband, Brad, uh, Taurus, Leo, Scorpio,\n\n31:20\nAquarius, and Gemini, and Virgo are going to feel the retrograde the most. Okay? So, you know that I said your\n\n31:27\nname. Yeah. So, you're in here. Uh, and remember, it's a good one. It's a good one. And if you have any planets between\n\n31:33\n3 to 17 degrees in any of the fixed signs, the first four signs that I said uh in your natal chart, remember it\n\n31:39\ndoesn't matter which one. You look at the angular aspects and yes, you'll feel it the most most. Now, Friday, July\n\n31:44\n18th, Mercury will sex all Venus. I love this. I This is great.

This in\n\n33:19\nyour second house. And, you know, uh, have some fun with this and go shopping because I'm going to tell you two\n\n33:24\nthings. Well, first of all, when I say magnetic, Linda Cardellini, Jason Stathithm,\n\n33:30\nSam Hugahan, I don't I don't know how to say his name, the guy from Outlander, they all have this in their charge. So,\n\n33:37\nthat's what I'm saying. That magnetism, they're just naturally like So, it's almost So, you're embracing these\n\n33:43\nqualities now. Crosswatchers, fire signs, Aries, Leo, Sagittarius, and air\n\n33:49\nsigns, Gemini, Libra, Aquarius, they're going to feel this the most. And I am throwing in Virgo and Taurus. And if you\n\n33:56\nhave any planets in your chart between 13 to 17°, any of those signs, yeah, you're going\n\n34:02\nto please use this. You're going to you're probably going to get some great news\n\n34:09\nor feel very like compelling. Why? Because\n\n34:16\nI don't even know if it's on the whiteboard, but uh the moon's going to be in your sign. The moon is in your\n\n34:21\nsign Taurus on this day. I you can hear me right.\n\n34:31\nThe moon in your the moon is exalted in your sign and what it's going to do it's going to sexile Jupiter that's exalted\n\n34:39\nin cancer. You're really rising above this is this\n\n34:45\nthe moon. Okay. So the moon in your sign sex Jupiter and cancer it just brings\n\n34:51\nall this optimism and I really love this for you and even this grounding energy again you still\n\n34:57\nhave Mars in Virgo as well but just there is a sense of like everything that's happening right now there is\n\n35:03\nsomething here again communication is going to be really big for you I would not be if there's something that you're\n\n35:09\ntrying to propose there's something that your uh agreements verbal agreements e like or contracts things that there's\n\n35:16\njust stuff like remember it's just any of those like yeah you can just spend some time looking over it. Here's the\n\n35:24\nthing the moon exalts in your sign that just makes you feel emotional stable.\n\n35:29\nThere's a sense of like abundance, material abundance, and it's so nurturing. And so it's it brings wealth.\n\n35:38\nAnd remember, you're Venus ruled, and you have this other great sexile with Venus right now that's in your house.\n\n35:47\nUse this. Remember V treat yourself. Please treat yourself this day. And you\n\n35:52\nprobably will. There's probably something that you like a little maybe even like a mini celebration, but remember Venus is like shopping and\n\n35:58\nluxuries and beautifying and and you know spa like go to the spa, go get your\n\n36:04\nnails done. I don't know the color like little pumpkins on it. I don't know. I\n\n36:11\ndon't know what the trend is. But here's the other thing is that I just lost my notes. So, um where do they go? Let me\n\n36:18\nimprov uh while I find your notes. Let me pull up your notes. Oh my gosh. Uh, thank you, Uranus. So, you're going to\n\n36:24\nsee a lot of this. Okay. It's so funny. Uranus is always doing these little things to me. He's been doing these things to me. Um, right on my ascendant.\n\n36:33\nTaurus, you want to hear a joke? Uh, okay. So, what is uh Oh, found it. Okay,\n\n36:39\nhere we are. So, um, Taurus, now on the 19th, July 19th, this is the day that I\n\n36:46\nreally want you to mark on your calendar, okay? because this is the day that Saturn and Neptune, they're going to be the closest they have been yet.\n\n36:52\nAll right, remember they're in that conjunction. They're less that they're like literally I think this is like 13\n\n36:58\nminutes away. I mean, they are h less than half a degree basically. So again, you're going to really really feel this\n\n37:04\nday. Okay. But because it is in your 12th house, it's going to be just again\n\n37:10\nyou may just feel this surge of this meaningful like I just want just life\n\n37:17\npurpose. It just all of that's going to come up. I mean you got the moon in your sign. You got so much happening for you.\n\n37:23\nIt's very spiritual. And again if there are any things that come up that you may\n\n37:28\nit's you know let's just say shadow work. Yeah. with all these retrogrades\n\n37:34\nand whatnot that you're going to feel confident to face it like\n\n37:40\nI'm good. Now, Sunday, July 20th, you have Mars conjuncting uh the south node\n\n37:45\nexactly at 19°. We talked about this last week. You know, this is big and uh\n\n37:51\none of the reasons one of the reasons why it is big is because Venus will square Mars next\n\n37:58\nweek. Okay, just after and so you start feeling Venus. So now Venus is squaring\n\n38:05\nMars and the south node conjuncting. So she's now part of the mix. She's now part of this farewell party because\n\n38:13\nremember what is this? This is Mars on the south node. You this a are going to\n\n38:19\nsay what's no longer part of my journey. What's no longer necessary? What's got\n\n38:24\nto go? It's Mars and K2 tail of the dragon. Okay. So, um releasing old\n\n38:31\npatterns, old habits, old thoughts. I've been telling you out with the old, in with the new. I said Mars is going to be\n\n38:37\nlike a laser this day. If you haven't let something go that you intuitively know it's like it we got to let this go,\n\n38:44\ny'all. Mars is going to come in and I had to do it. All right. So, this is\n\n38:50\nin your fifth house. Okay. So, fifth house is true love. It's pleasure, okay?\n\n38:57\nIt's it's soulmate energy, like I said. It's uh it's romance, it's family, it's\n\n39:03\nchildren, it's procreation, having kids, it's uh sex. Therefore, uh\n\n39:12\nI'm just saying that because you have Venus in anyway. So, uh you Yeah. So,\n\n39:18\ncreative projects is a big thing here, okay? Because it's Leo's home. Leo natively rules the fifth. All right. So\n\n39:25\nthere's again when I look what's happening for you that you have a lot of home and family energy. So when I say\n\n39:31\nwhat's got to go, what is it that's got to go? Because you have five\n\n39:36\nretrogrades. You have six heavenly bodies in your 12th house of the past.\n\n39:42\nYou have Chiron activated. Chiron that has to do with the past. So this is the\n\n39:49\nsouth node that has to do with the past. So this is a day where the past is going\n\n39:55\nto come to you. Okay, Taurus. And the past is going to say please let me go. I\n\n40:03\nwant to be history. Okay, even like I said, Venus is also in the\n\n40:09\nmix. She's also saying Taurus can you please this this is not serving you\n\n40:14\nwell. All right. So all the things that can be here is it really is something\n\n40:20\nwith your lifestyle something that has to do with even work. Virgo just natively rules a workplace. So is it a\n\n40:27\ncolleague? Is it one of your employees that you're like okay that I you know given them you know a couple chances and\n\n40:33\nthey haven't um but you know it's also health matters. Is there something that\n\n40:38\nyou you know again it's health habit lifestyle old patterns but with all this buildup in your 12th house again is it\n\n40:46\npessimistic thinking are you telling your remember that's the place of self-sabotage are you telling yourself I\n\n40:51\ncan't have this or I'm not good enough for this or are you making excuses like that and I'm not saying you are I'm saying these are things that could come\n\n40:57\nup and that's when you're like because you have all this empowering energy this is the day you're\n\n41:04\nlike okay I'm not going to think this way anymore and that's the It could just be the way that you see something. Remember, this is a week of your\n\n41:10\nperspective shift and really going within to figure out what that is. Yeah, if you don't know at this point, a lot\n\n41:17\nof y'all will from the beginning. But the other thing is it's your fifth house. And so there is an element of\n\n41:23\nlike it seems like you're getting really serious about other things.\n\n41:29\nPerhaps you are having a baby. Perhaps you are thinking of moving cross country. Perhaps you are, you know, just\n\n41:35\nstarted a business or you just, you know, booked a book deal or, you know,\n\n41:40\nyou you you're the next Tom Cruz. Whatever it is, you're busy. And so with\n\n41:47\nthis in your fifth house of fun and pleasure, there's just something and it's recreation as well. There just may\n\n41:54\nbe something if you go, you know, kiteboarding\n\n42:01\nnine times a week. You might and because it's just so fun\n\n42:07\nfor you, you might have to Okay, maybe it might have to be once a week. All\n\n42:13\nright, you're getting too busy in other stuff. And that's all I'm saying. It doesn't have to be a complete it just\n\n42:20\nyou can you just got to make room for all the new stuff. Okay. All the new stuff that you want for your v vision\n\n42:27\nmoving forward. You're going to have to make room for it. Okay. That's all I'm saying. Virgo is purification by the\n\n42:34\nway. So there is something here that is you're being you're purging something. Okay. This is south node and there's\n\n42:39\nit's non-negotiable. All right. That's why I've been really talking about this because Mars can come it can come in\n\n42:46\nhard. Okay. And a lot of you it's just going to be like a detoxing but again a lot of it may be of the mind and it's\n\n42:53\njust to have that harmony and it's going to start with your mind. I mean Virgo rules the mind and it's not even just\n\n42:58\nthat. Virgo rules the digestive system too by the way. So there may be something here with food in your diet,\n\n43:04\nokay? Because you do have uh Uranus and Venus in your second anyway. But that's\n\n43:11\nthat's what I'm saying. Okay. There just may be something even with finances. I'm not obviously a financial adviser or\n\n43:17\nanything like that. I'm just saying that there may be something that comes up that's part of the story. All right?\n\n43:23\nSomething's got to go. Uh and you honestly you have Mars, Venus, Uranus,\n\n43:28\nSouth Node all in Mercury ruled signs. I mean this is while Mercury's retrograde. So this is a lot of mutable energy.\n\n43:35\nGemini, Virgo really activated right now. Okay. So just get ready for change is all it's saying. Okay. get ready for\n\n43:43\nchange and you will be busy communicating and there's something here that you're gonna like it's like I've\n\n43:48\ngot to let this go and it can be the hard way but also it can be like you already know and you're like okay yeah\n\n43:54\nI'm not I can't go out every night till 4 in the morning with the friends up you know and\n\n44:00\nI I I gota you know I got to build this rocket ship whatever it is you will know\n\n44:06\nwhat it is Virgo like I said rules the digestive system rules the gut trust\n\n44:11\nyour gut gut instinct things. Yeah. And even Gemini at play because by the way,\n\n44:17\nwhat did I just say about money? Well, the moon will be in Gemini this day. So, this is all part of your awakening. This\n\n44:23\nis all part of your transformation. Okay? So, you this is big. This is really big because you got the north\n\n44:29\nnode in Pisces anyway, which is very spiritual. It's very finding your purpose, moving in the direction of your\n\n44:35\ndestiny, having your awakening, but also it is in your your it's in your 11th house. only you Taurus only you of your\n\n44:42\nfuture whole uh hopes and dreams and your aspirations your long-term commitments so yeah this is a big day\n\n44:49\nyou got you it's a big day it's and 19 degrees again this is at 19° I don't\n\n44:55\nthink I said it last week but 19 degrees in astrology it really is it's Libra right so it's understanding the laws of\n\n45:01\nkarma cause and effect it's with the nodes it's with the nodes of karma and\n\n45:08\nfade and destiny So again, there's something here that's just Mars may be like, \"Okay, we're just going to Yeah.\n\n45:15\nUh, and Mars will actually sex all Juno.\" All right. So once again, Juno,\n\n45:20\nJupiter's wife, all about truth, justice, equality, fairness in legal matters, contracts, marriage, personal\n\n45:27\nrelationship. So there may be something here, an adjustment, okay, to make room\n\n45:32\nfor something, not make room for something. But at the end of the day, you've got the moon in Gemini. Am I\n\n45:38\nright? The moon there. Uh so, okay, let me just tell you why this is such a big\n\n45:44\nday. It's not just Mars conjuncting the south node. You got the moon in Gemini. Therefore, the moon will conjunct Uranus\n\n45:50\nin your second house. Okay, so this is breakthroughs, a lot of creative energy, freedom, but finances as well.\n\n45:56\nSelf-worth, self value. The moon will conjunct Venus this day as well in Gemini, which is very auspicious, very\n\n46:03\nfavorable. This is very stimulating. Again, money is just a thing. Venus is money in your second house of money with\n\n46:08\nthe moon in Gemini like there's something here okay finances but still\n\n46:15\njust a lot of creative energy for you and then the moon will sexile Saturn and Neptune and try and Pluto like I can't make this up like this is a big day all\n\n46:22\nright so just know that there's something here I want you to think back\n\n46:27\nwhat happened for you March what was what was the story line when we had the\n\n46:33\neclipse in Virgo Okay, because this is we're pretty much at the midpoint. Okay,\n\n46:41\nwe had an eclipse in Virgo in March that was in your fifth house and we have that eclipse in Virgo that's in your fifth\n\n46:48\nhouse in September. But next month in August, we have a new moon in Virgo.\n\n46:55\nThat was not a verbal typo. We have a new moon in Virgo in August. We have a\n\n47:00\nnew moon solar eclipse in Virgo in September. So back to back Virgo new\n\n47:05\nmoons. I'll explain it when we get to August. But that is your fifth house. So\n\n47:11\ndo you see you have something new coming in your fifth house of pleasure and joy and true love and romance and children\n\n47:17\nand so you've got to let something go to make room for that is all I'm saying\n\n47:23\nright now. Signs who's going to feel this the most this conjunction Gemini,\n\n47:28\nVirgo, Sagittarius, Pisces, all the mutable signs. If you have any planets 17 to 21° in any of those signs, you\n\n47:35\nwill feel it the most most most. Okay? And remember, you've got Cirrus, you got Juno, you got\n\n47:42\nAries, you got so much happening um this week. And um Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And\n\n47:48\nthen uh Okay. Did I even show you that? The Great Awakener. Yeah. Or Great Awakener. It works both ways. So, um\n\n47:54\nyeah, that's my new site. Look at my last live stream. I talked about it. And because Uranus is on my ascendant,\n\n48:01\ny'all know what's happened. So, uh, it it might be ready, it might not be. All right. There's, you know, I I don't\n\n48:08\ncontrol the developers. Let's see what's going on for you, Taurus. And it is where I do, you know, extended\n\n48:14\npredictions, and I'm teaching astrology and tarot, but in fun ways and free tarot readings and all of that. On that\n\n48:20\nside, we're going to have so much fun. Taurus, let's see what's going on for you, okay? for July 14th to the 20th.\n\n48:30\nI think that card really wanted to Okay, so we're going to do you Hey, look at you. Look how lucky you are already.\n\n48:37\nYou have a bonus card that came out. You got a bonus card. Taurus, I do a traditional uh Celtic cross spread\n\n48:44\noffers the best overview if we need to pull clarifiers. Well, yeah. Um we will\n\n48:50\nthen. All right. And uh what was it? I forgot what I was going to say. Oh yeah, I love y'all. You know, I love y'all.\n\n48:57\nTaurus Taurus, I'm I'm just so I I love y'all. Y'all are amazing. I know.\n\n49:03\nSo I have, you know, Taurus friends have gone through a lot. And then, you know, I have friends that are Taurus rising\n\n49:08\nwho have, you know, stories, but just seeing where they're at now, it's just it's so nice. All right, so let's get\n\n49:15\nstarted. Yeah, you're you're I don't even know what to say. I you're you're you're good AF. I'm going to give you a\n\n49:24\nI'm going to spin the world for you.\n\n49:30\nHow is this even like What the heck? Okay.\n\n49:35\nUm, so I I just told you that you're going through this. This is going to be an\n\n49:41\namazing week for you. And you know, the moon in your sign really helps with, you know, the connection with Jupiter. But\n\n49:47\nanyway, um, there you go. You're good. I don't even know like a your your reading\n\n49:53\nis going to be so easy. Okay, you got the wheel of fortune. Great. I talked about karma. You're on a karmic journey.\n\n49:58\nYou have all these activations with the nodes of fate and karma. Like you got Saturn karma. You got a lot happening\n\n50:05\nhere. There you go. Just work with your karma. You're you're cashing in your karma points. You got the wheel of\n\n50:10\nfortune attributed to the planet Jupiter. Yeah. So, there's like I said, I told you something faded's going to\n\n50:16\nhappen for you this week where there you go. There's your affirmation. A lot of y'all are, you know, I dropped these forecasts a little bit earlier than the\n\n50:22\nweek begins. So, you may be uh already moving into it, but it's almost like this new again, you out of all the\n\n50:29\nsigns, I just feel like are going to be the most focused on your future and your dreams and but that feel-good energy\n\n50:36\naround it when you manifest, you're going to make things happen. Some of y'all may not even know that's other\n\n50:42\nthing. what you like you can't even picture yourself like 2 years from now,\n\n50:47\n5 years from now, but it doesn't matter because at least you're putting attention there. At least you're putting\n\n50:52\nenergy there and everything will f you know everything will fill up for you. Like this is amazing. Um and it does\n\n50:59\nfeel like there's something here that's happening by the way that uh you know it is a 10 too. So uh it's almost like\n\n51:06\nthere's this again something really brand new happening for you. And then you got the nine of pentacles and the heart of your spread.\n\n51:12\nBut what I say about that freess that freedom you got Uranus and Gemini in your second Uranus is all about freedom\n\n51:17\nand liberating herself and freess and that is what she has done. She has and what did I even say from the beginning\n\n51:23\nbe proud of yourself because you just went through Uranus in your sign and look at where you're at now. That's the same thing here. She worked hard. She\n\n51:30\nearned her spot here and look at how the universe\n\n51:35\nis, you know, repaying her. This is it's\n\n51:41\ncoming after the card of karma. Yeah, that's what happens. Okay, so abundance, wealth, self-sufficiency,\n\n51:48\nnot worrying about money. This is a lot of independent energy. This is also a Virgo card. Okay, it's actually Venus in\n\n51:54\nVirgo. You can even see the symbol of Venus all over her gown. But again that Virgo story that Virgo story line in\n\n52:00\nyour fifth house of fun, pleasure, joy, family, children, babies, creative projects, you that's the other thing\n\n52:06\nlike the birth of creative projects like things like that too big. You're good. This you're going to feel so on top of\n\n52:12\nthe world this week. I love that. Hold on to that energy. Um she's so regal. Remember I said Venus and Gemini in you\n\n52:19\nlike just being in your house like you're just going to be very magnetic. So you do not want to waste this week,\n\n52:24\nright? You want to go out there and attract. It's a loss of attraction, right? You have the two of swords here.\n\n52:29\nUh that I don't mind it. It does look like that uh two well a it looks like you're going to come out of something\n\n52:35\nthat you're just like you have been sitting on. Um and give it some time. There's no rush. You I mean the\n\n52:40\nretrograd's for some time right next week to like so there's no rush. Um there may be something that you're going\n\n52:46\nto be sitting on, you're going to be thinking about, but just you know don't get stuck there. The second thing is like yes there may be something that and\n\n52:53\nit's like once you come out of this you got that big clarity but there may be also someone that remember you have some\n\n53:00\nactivity with uh you know someone else and you know partnership relationship can be love career can be your you know\n\n53:05\nUber driver doesn't matter like just just oneonone personal relationships okay this is also a Libra card it's\n\n53:11\nattributed to moon in Libra so therefore you know with even Juno in the mix this week we are bringing in contracts and\n\n53:18\nagreements ments that you know you may be sitting on but there may be someone else. Okay. So partnerships or contracts\n\n53:24\nor agreements, right? So uh someone else on and and and you got to just give them\n\n53:30\nsome time. Okay. Mercury is retrograde. Now you got Queen of Cups. Yeah. Amazing. What did I say? You're\n\n53:36\ngoing to feel really good. you're gonna feel like spiritually like awakened. Even with the Queen of Cups who is so\n\n53:42\nspiritual, who's so, you know, uh, intimate and has all this emotional intelligence and she's just so connected\n\n53:49\nwith the divine. I love this. She does what her heart desires and she has so much heart to\n\n53:55\ngive and she leads with her heart. And there's what I love about the Queen of uh, Cups is that there's very few cards\n\n54:02\nin tarot where the color purple or violet actually exists. And it, you\n\n54:07\nknow, does have the shortest wavelength. So it has the highest output of energy.\n\n54:13\nAnd that's why, you know, our crown chakras are anyway. So you got it in your crown. That's why I'm saying like\n\n54:18\nyou're definitely going to get with all like remember you got six heavenly bodies in your 12th house. All right?\n\n54:23\nWhich is up here. All right. The spir it's very spiritual of the subconscious all of that. So there is something here\n\n54:28\nthat's very divine that you're going to have this awakening. Three of cups. You got something to celebrate. There's news\n\n54:35\nthat you're getting. There's, like I said earlier, okay, there's something here. There's going to be some mini I\n\n54:40\nsaid like a mini celebration. There's just going to be some joy. There's going to be a lot of It's like there's there's\n\n54:46\nthe big message coming to me is out with the old, in with the new. And that's what you're celebrating. Like something\n\n54:52\nis finally changing that it's Yeah. Like I've been putting my energy into it. And\n\n54:57\nthere you go. What did I say? What did I say? Okay. You got a lot to look forward to. You're planning about your future.\n\n55:03\nyour north node. The north node is in Pisces in your 11th house, which what\n\n55:08\ndid I say is your future hopes, long-term goals, wishes, dreams, all of that. And you got the star, which that\n\n55:15\nrepresents because the star is attributed to Aquarius who rules the\n\n55:20\n11th house right here. You're good. This is wisdom, inner wisdom. This is that's\n\n55:27\nwhy I say please use these the retrograde period. Please go within. You're good. A lot's going to come out. This is wisdom. This is like you know\n\n55:33\njust a lot of divine knowledge. This is just feeling that\n\n55:38\nthat theme of freedom is so strong here. Um you know even with her you know the\n\n55:45\nstar bear right not you know not wearing any clothes there's that freess you get\n\n55:50\nto express yourself. This card is also healing. It's it's also faith having faith in\n\n55:57\nyourself. Remember I said you you're doing that right now. building that confidence, self-worth, self I bet. Even\n\n56:02\nstill, stars aligning for you. You're really good. Your world, something's growing in your world in a really big way. Okay. A lot of wealth. Taurus,\n\n56:09\ny'all are amazing. You're you're the wealth magnet this week. Uh Taurus, um\n\n56:15\nif you like this reading, would be great if you like, subscribe, leave comments, tell me what is going on. And um yeah, I\n\n56:22\nreally want to know. You got a lot happening. And you know, I love y'all. All right, so let's see what Yeah. Don't\n\n56:28\nyou clearly you're good. Clearly, you know, like this is I don't even know\n\n56:33\nwhat to like. I don't know. I Okay. So, um why don't\n\n56:41\nwe just go with the fact that you're good and you did not only get the wheel\n\n56:47\nof fortune and the star in your main spread, you also got the star last week, too.\n\n56:58\nAnd you're so you're good. You're like it's like come on. And because I do the astrology like I said like that's like\n\n57:05\nevery everything's sequential. It's all connected from last week. It's like yeah,\n\n57:12\nKnight of Wands. Again, you're going to have a lot going on in your mind that that's that's, you know, write things\n\n57:18\ndown. Okay? Write things down. That's all it is. you're going to be ready to and you can you can but you still have\n\n57:25\nto a lot of the things that are happening up here. Um remember there's a difference between the physical mind and\n\n57:32\nthe higher mind. Okay. So merge the two because a lot of things when you go within this week with all the\n\n57:37\nretrogrades a lot of things are going to make sense for things that are happening in your physical mind. All right. So uh\n\n57:42\nyou got the six of wands here. I tell there's some recognition that's happening here, some achievement, some honor, some success. That's the six of\n\n57:49\nwands. I mean, you're good. That I mean, it it and there's movement here, which\n\n57:54\nis what I really love. Um, oh my goodness, especially with career. If\n\n57:59\nyou're here for career, um, there's I mean, look across your cross like you can't\n\n58:05\nyou you're rising above everything's working out for you. And by the way, it may be that's the moting factor\n\n58:12\nmotivating factor is because a lot of you on this, it's almost like you see this potential for fame.\n\n58:20\nYeah. And when I say that, yeah, it can be like within your industry, within your neighborhood, wherever you want it,\n\n58:25\njust being having that recognition. I feel like there's something you're going to really feel this week about that, the\n\n58:31\njust the recognition. Uh it seems really nice, too. And it seems like for a lot of you, someone else is involved on your\n\n58:38\njourney. Two of Wands. Uh yeah. Okay. So, uh great. Because you see the two\n\n58:45\nwands, he's Yeah. He's got the world in his hand. He's at the top of the top of the castle. And this is just saying,\n\n58:51\nyeah, there's a sense of like, yeah, I made it. I did it. I made this big achievement. Now, what's next? Yeah,\n\n59:00\nliterally what I said. So, take that time to plan as he is doing. He's mapping things out. He's got a great\n\n59:07\nview of his future. You can't make this up. And then you\n\n59:12\nhave the King of Wands in your final outcome. What did I say? You're going to get that recognition. What did I say? You're going to be sitting in this throne. You're going to be right.\n\n59:18\nThere's a lot you're moving toward. This is, by the way, the King of Wands is a fun king. A lot of fiery energy. It's\n\n59:24\nthe epitome of fire. Yeah. Wands are your passions. It's very spirited, very invigorating, very lively, a lot of\n\n59:31\ncreative energy, a lot of sexual energy, by the way, because you Okay, so FYI,\n\n59:37\nbut uh I love this. It's just like this huge transformation that you're going through. Huge major. Okay. And you can\n\n59:43\nsee um with the king of wands in your final outcome, I just feel like like you will have this vision and there is a\n\n59:50\nsense of he's a big leader and again like I said you're becoming leaders and again in any like you have so much\n\n59:56\ncareer stuff happen happening right you have so much uh home and family stuff happening but at the end of the day it's\n\n60:03\njust like you feeling that I feel so good I feel so free I worked\n\n60:08\nmy way up I yeah because just like the nine of pentacles he als Also, he he's\n\n60:14\nnot sitting in this throne from succession. Like, he worked his way up to become throne or the king. And uh so,\n\n60:23\nI really love this. Uh you're really good. You don't even need any clarifiers. Uh Taurus, y'all are amazing. Next week, oh gosh, next week.\n\n60:29\nYeah, we'll talk about we got new moon in Leo. Like again, like there's a there's a lot happening next week. All right. So, uh Taurus, y'all are amazing.\n\n60:36\nTier three members, you know where to find the link. Thanks so much. I'll see you next week. you are. Oh, wait, wait,\n\n60:41\nwait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Yeah, let's see. Okay, the card that\n\n60:46\nthat Yeah, remember\n\n60:52\nhow psychic are you? Can you take a guess and think about what card do you think this is?\n\n60:58\nPut in the comments. I want to know.\n\n61:04\nYou're good. You're good. Just believe in. just continue to believe in yourself. Have that inner\n\n61:11\ncourage, inner strength, have that feel that power, feel that like even with Mars conjuncting the south node like\n\n61:16\nyeah know what has to go and just be like you know what don't like dillydally\n\n61:22\njust be like you know and that's amazing. You got strength. Strength is attributed to Leo. Remember, that's a\n\n61:29\nlot of home and family energy for y'all, okay? Just in general. But, uh, it's still just you. All right? Just feeling\n\n61:37\nempowered. There's so much empowerment here. Like, you have nothing here that you you're good. This is going to be one\n\n61:42\nof your best weeks. All right.
